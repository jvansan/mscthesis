\chapter{Do non-redox active metal cations have the potentials to behave as chemo-protective agents? The Effects on Metal Cations on HAT Reaction Barrier Heights}
\label{ch:hat}

\section{Introduction}

Metal cations are ubiquitous in biological systems and play an important role in biological function. As such, there is a great deal of interest in studying metals in biological systems. Proteins in particular are often associated with metals, and in the worldwide Protein Data Bank,\cite{Harding2010, Berman2007} over one-third of crystal structures contain metals. Redox active metals, such as copper and iron, act as co-factors in metalloenzymes for important catalytic processes.\cite{Atkins2010}

Non-redox active metal cations are equally as important in biological function as redox active metals, where they are essential to protein structure and function, along with cellular and neuronal signaling.\cite{Karp1999} Sodium and calcium ions are most abundant extracellurly, while potassium and magnesium are dominant inside of cells. While specific ionic concentrations vary dramatically dependening on physiological conditions, estimates for equilibrium concentrations in both mammalian heart cells\cite{Ingwall2006} and blood plasma\cite{daSilva2001} are listed in~\ref{tab:metalconc}. As sodium and magnesium are most abundant alkali and alkaline earth metals found in biologically relevant systems, they are of prime interest for investigation.

\end{table}

Extensive crystallographic surveys indicate that metals bind predominantly to oxygen centres in proteins.\cite{Harding1999, Harding2004, Hsin2008} Divalent metals are most often found bound directly to proteins. Calcium binds anywhere from 4 to 6 binding sites in protein crystal structures, while magnesium binds only 1 or 2. Monovalent metals, on the other hand, are often heavily solvated and so they appear in solvent cavities of proteins, although sodium or potassium are sometimes found bound directly to carbonyl or carboxylate oxygen centres.\cite{Harding2010}

A great deal of research has focussed on \ch{Ca^{2+}} in the context of reactive oxygen-centred radical production.\cite{Goerlach2015} Specifically, \ch{Ca^{2+}} ions are important in the mitochondria, where, depending on physiological conditions and concentrations, they can act as inhibitor or promoters of free-radical production in the electron transport chain.\cite{AdamVizi2010} In explanation is that \ch{Ca^{2+}} induce conformational changes of the proteins involved in the electron transport chain which are responsible for radical generation.\cite{Brookes2004} Mitochondrial free-radicals, when present in moderate amounts, can act as cell signalling molecules to activate pro-growth responses.\cite{Sullivan2014} However, ``dysfunctional'' mitochondria can produce excess radicals leading to oxidative damage which has been linked to degenerative diseases.

Given the significant importance alkali and alkaline earth metals play in biological systems, their impact on protein oxidation must be considered. However, until recently, kinetic studies of protein oxidation have not investigated the mechanistic role of non-redox active metals. In a series of three papers,\cite{Salamone2013a, Salamone2015metals, Salamone2016} Bietti and colleagues have shown that alkali and alkaline earth metals have an inhibitory effect on HAT reactions involving \cumo\ and organic substrates. Some of the experimental rate constants from these papers are summarized in~\ref{tab:hat-metals}. All rate constants were obtained by time-resolved LFP in nitrogen or argon-saturated acetonitrile (MeCN) at 298 K, as was previously described in Section~\ref{sec:hat-methods}. All of the experimental results have been rationalized on the basis of Lewis acid metals cations interactions with Lewis basic substrates.

Firstly, for hydrocarbons, cyclic ethers, and tertiary amines, \cumo\ hydrogen abstraction rate constants in the presence of excess concentrations of lithium and magnesium salts were measured.\cite{Salamone2013a} In the presence of \ch{LiClO4} and \ch{Mg(ClO4)2}, the rate of abstraction by \cumo\ from 1,4-cyclohexadiene (CHD) increases very slightly. Since CHD has no Lewis basic centres, the increase in HAT rate constant was explained on the basis of metal cation interactions with \cumo, very slightly increasing the hydrogen abstraction ability by withdrawing electron density from the aromatic ring. Metal cations were also shown to increase the unimolecular decay of \cumo\ by $\beta$-scission (See Section~\ref{sec:hat-methods}). The largest kinetic effect was observed with \ch{LiClO4} with $k_\beta$ = 1.8\E{6} $s^{-1}$, which is a
roughly 3-fold increase as compared to the rate in MeCN at 298 K ($k_\beta$\cite{Avila1995} = 6.3\E{5} $s^{-1}$). This effect is significantly less than the observed kinetic solvent effect on \cumo\ $\beta$-scission measured in \ch{H2O} or 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol ($k_\beta$ = 1.0\E{7} and 6.1\E{6} $s^{-1}$, respectively).\cite{Bietti2005, Neta1984} Therefore, the kinetic effects of these alkali and alkaline metal salts interacting via Lewis acid-base interactions with the oxygen-centre of \cumo\ are less than the effects of hydrogen-bonding by solvents.

Next, the HAT rate constants for abstraction from tetrahydrofuran (THF) decrease in the presence of non-redox active metal salts. Both \ch{LiClO4} and \ch{LiOTf} decrease $k_H$ by a factor of about 2, indicating the nature of the counter-anion plays a negligible role in the Lewis acid-base interactions between metal cations and substrates. The addition of \ch{Mg(ClO4)2} has a greater effect on HAT reactivity, decreasing $k_H$ by a factor of 3. Magnesium ions are a stronger Lewis acid than lithium,\cite{Fukuzumi2002} supporting the notion of Lewis acid-base interactions between the oxygen lone-pair and the metal cations. The decrease in $k_H$ has been partially attributed to the reduction in hyperconjugative overlap between the oxygen lone-pair and the neighbouring \ch{C-H} $\sigma^*$ anti-bonding orbital (See~\ref{fig:THF}), as a consequence of the metal cation withdrawing electron density from the oxygen lone-pair.

A 2-fold decrease in $k_H$ for the tertiary amine, triethylamine (TEA), is observed upon the addition of \ch{LiClO4}, for which an analogous orbital interaction explanation is also appropriate. Interestingly, the addition of 1.0 M \ch{Mg(ClO4)2} was reported to immediately form a precipitate to form. This precipitate was identified as the formation of a strong TEA-\ch{Mg^{2+}} Lewis acid-base adduct. This observation is once again consistent with the stronger Lewis acidity of \ch{Mg^{2+}} as compared to \ch{Li^+}, and also the significantly greater Lewis basicity of TEA vs THF.\cite{Salamone2013a, Reichardt2010} It was also pointed out that MeCN will competitively bind with metal cations, however it is a weaker Lewis base than both THF and TEA. Measurements of $k_H$ for HAT between \cumo\ and TEA in the presence of 0.005 M \ch{Mg(ClO4)2} were successful only up until [TEA] = 9.6 mM, at which point a precipitate began to form. Nonetheless, an upper limit to the hydrogen abstraction rate constant was estimated as $k_H <$ 1\E{6} \Ms, or at least a 200 fold decrease relative to no metal salt. Very similar results for bulkier tertiary amines were also obtained. Thus, the presence of strong Lewis acids in the presence of Lewis basic sites on hydrogen atom donors can deactivate \ch{C-H} bonds.

Next, we turn to the more relevant models for the work of this thesis, the tertiary amides $N,N$-dimethylformamide (DMF) and $N,N$-dimethylacetamide (DMA). As with THF, normal hyperconjugative overlap between the conjugated amide $\pi$-system and the adjacent \ch{C-H} $\sigma^*$ anti-bonding orbitals weakens the C-H bonds. Therefore, metal binding to the amide oxygen-centre should result in a decrease in this orbital interaction, strengthen the C-H bonds, and decrease HAT reactivity. In their study, \citet{Salamone2015metals} measured \cumo\ abstraction rate constants from DMF and DMA in the presence of stoichiometric equivalents of \ch{LiClO4}, \ch{LiOTf}, \ch{NaClO4}, \ch{Mg(ClO4)2}, and \ch{Ca(ClO4)2} (in contrast to the excess used in Reference~\citenum{Salamone2013a}). Figure~\ref{fig:k-metals-mg}a,b shows the plots of $k_{obs}$ against [substrate] for the reactions of \cumo with DMF and DMA in MeCN containing 0.2 M \ch{Mg(ClO4)2}, respectively. For both DMF and DMA, there are three distinct regions in the plots: weak C-H bond activation for [amide]/[\ch{Mg^{2+}}]$\leq 2$, followed by strong C-H bond deactivation for 2$<$[amide]/[\ch{Mg^{2+}}]$\leq$4, and no deactivation for [amide]/[\ch{Mg^{2+}}]$<$4.

The addition of both \ch{LiClO4} and \ch{LiOTf} decrease to a similar extent the rate constants for abstraction from DMF and DMA by \cumo. However, in contrast to \ch{Mg(ClO4)2}, the lithium salts strongly deactivate \ch{C-H} bonds for 2 equivalents, followed by weak deactivation for another 2 equivalents, and no deactivation for [amide]/[\ch{Li^{+}}]$<$4. Salamone et al. were not able to give a clear cut explanation, but suggest that the different patterns are a result of differences in charge density, which is greater for \ch{Mg^{2+}} than \ch{Li^+}, as well as different coordination geometries of the two ions. A coordination number of 4 is most common for \ch{Li^+}, while an octahedral geometry with the coordination of 6 ligands is almost always observed for \ch{Mg^{2+}}.\cite{Babu2013, Dudev2014} As a result, interactions of the ions with solvent and counter-anions are suggested to be more important for \ch{Mg^{2+}} than \ch{Li^+}.

\ch{NaClO4} and \ch{Ca(ClO4)2} influence HAT between \cumo\ and DMA to different extents than both \ch{LiClO4} and \ch{Mg(ClO4)2}. Figure~\ref{fig:k-metals-naca}a,b shows the plots of $k_{obs}$ against [substrate] for the reactions of \cumo with DMA in MeCN containing 0.2 M \ch{NaClO4} and \ch{Mg(ClO4)2}, respectively. For \ch{NaClO4}, an almost negligible deactivation of \ch{C-H} bonds is observed for up to 4 equivalents of DMA. This was explained on the basis of the weaker Lewis acidity of \ch{Na^+} as compared to \ch{Li^+}. With regards to \ch{Ca(ClO4)2}, binding to DMA fully deactivates \ch{C-H} bond abstraction up to 4 equivalents of DMA. The first region of~\ref{fig:k-metals-naca}b ([DMA] = 0--0.2 M, black circles) represents the decrease in $k_\beta$ of \cumo as \ch{Ca^{2+}} preferentially binds to DMA over \cumo. Interestingly, for both DMF and DMA, the same experiments in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent show no inhibition of HAT reactivity by metal cations. This was rationalized on the basis of the stronger Lewis basicity of DMSO as compared to both MeCN and the amides, thus the metals preferentially bind solvent rather than amide substrate.

Finally, \citet{Salamone2016} examined the effects of substrate structure on HAT reaction between \cumo\ and tertiary alkanamides in the presence of alkali and alkaline earth metal ions. For $N,N$-dialkylacetamides, the steric bulk of the $N$-alkyl groups was previously characterized.\cite{Salamone2014} Steric repulsion between \cumo\ and the $N$-alkyl groups can decreases the HAT rate constant, as evident by the 3-fold decrease in $k_H$ in going from DMA to $N,N$-diisobutylacetamide (DIA; 1.2\E{6} and 3.1\E{5} \Ms, respectively). For reactions of \cumo\ with DIA addition of 0.2 M \ch{LiClO4} or \ch{Ca(ClO4)2} to results in the same trends in \ch{C-H} bond deactivation observed for DMA. This indicates that the influence of metal cation-substrate binding is not significantly influences by the steric bulk of $N$-alkyl groups.  The same is true for the addition of 0.2 M \ch{Mg(ClO4)2} to abstraction from DIA by \cumo, as shown in~\ref{fig:k-dia-mg}. Once again, an slight decrease in reactivity is observed for the first 2 equivalents of DIA, followed by strong C-H bond deactivation for an additional two equivalents, and no deactivation beyond that. No additional insight was provided by Salamone et al. as to the reason for this reactivity. The plausible explanation provided was once again that \ch{Mg^{2+}} has a high charge density. These results show that Lewis acid-base interactions between alkali or alkaline earth metal cations can greatly depress hydrogen abstraction by alkyoxyl radicals.

With these results in mind, I am interested in the possibility that alkali and alkaline earth metal cations found in biological system can protect \ch{C-H} bonds in proteins from HAT to reactive oxygen-centred radicals. However, the experimental results do not answer some of the key physico-chemical determinants which may make this possible. Specifically, I have composed several important research questions which remain unclear from the experimental results.

The first question which I have is one of methodology: Can DFT-based methods can accurately treat alkali/alkaline metal cation binding to organic substrates or radicals? There exists limited ab initio data describing these interactions.\cite{ Siu2001, Corral2003, Suarez2011, Baldauf2013} Therefore, I have conducted a benchmark quality study involving \ch{Li^+}, \ch{Na^+}, \ch{Mg^{2+}}, \ch{K^+}, and \ch{Ca^{2+}}. to the best of my knowledge, this represents the first systematic benchmark study of these metal cations with both organic substrates and radicals.

Secondly, the nature of the binding of metal ions to substrates is still poorly described, especially given the odd stoichiometric effects observed for \ch{Mg(ClO4)2} with alkanamides. Specifically, I wish to address the range of these interactions, and how much the metals effect the C-H being broken. To address this I have utilized both \ch{Na^+} and \ch{Mg^{2+}} in my calculations. These metal ions were chosen to capture the large differences in Lewis acidity and ion size associated with these third-period ions, and because they are two of the most biologically relevant metal ions.

Thirdly, I address the effect that metal ions have on the HAT barrier heights.
Experiments demonstrate that under certain conditions the presence of metal ions can decrease HAT reactivity. If metal ions do effectively increase C-H bond strengths, this will certainly be a contributing factor to the free energy barrier. There will likely be additional factors such as polarization in the TS complex, or other effects of possible charge transfer from the substrate to metal ions. To investigate this, I have primarily studied HAT reactions involving DMA and oxygen-centred radicals. Given there are only experimental data for \cumo, this is the primary subject, however I was interested in structural differences of the oxygen-centred radical, thus I have utilized \bno\ as well, which differs significantly in that it has the ability to form strong pre-reaction complexes with hydrogen bond accepting substrates.\cite{Salamone2012, Salamone2013} I also investigated the effect metal cations have on the abstraction from DMA by the more biologically relevant hydroxyl radical. I have also performed calculations with the bulkier DIA substrate and \cumo\ to verify whether or not steric bulk does have an influence on the ability of a metal cation to effect HAT reactions.

Finally, given that reactions of DMA with \cumo\ in the presence of metal salts show no deactivation, I was interested in studying the reactivity of alkoxyl radicals with strong Lewis bases. HAT reactions involving alkoxyl radicals and strong Lewis bases have been previously studied,\cite{Salamone2012, vanSanten2016} and can possess interesting and unusual chemical reactivity. For instance, we recently showed that for the HAT reaction between \bno and DMSO, \bno acts as in reverse as a hydrogen atom donor rather the acceptor.\cite{vanSanten2016} In light of this, I examined the effect of metal cations on the expected HAT reactivity between \cumo\ and DMSO, as well as the ``reverse'' HAT reactivity between \bno\ and DMSO. I also performed calculations to determine the effects of metal cations and if there exists reverse reactivity for two other strong Lewis basic substrates: hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) and tributylphosphine oxide (TBPO). The chemical structures of all the species studies herein are shown in~\ref{fig:hat-subs}.

\section{Computational methods and details}

All quantum mechanical calculations were performed using either the Gaussian 09 software package,\cite{Frisch2009} or the TURBOMOLE software package.\cite{turbomole} Calculations for the benchmark quality data of metal binding to substrates were first optimized at the LC-$\omega$PBE-D3(BJ)/6-31+G(2d,2p) level of theory,\cite{Vydrov2006, Vydrov2006a, Grimme2010, Johnson2006} and later re-optimized with larger 6-311+G(3df,3pd) basis sets. Single-point energy calculations were then carried out using the coupled cluster methodology with single, double and perturbative triples with full core correlation, CCSD(T,Full), and various basis sets, as will be described in Section~\ref{sec:benchmark}. Final benchmark quality binding energies have been calculated using the F12$^*$ explicitly correlated method with Def2-QZVPPD primary basis sets and Def2-QZVPP auxiliary basis sets required for the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation as implemented in TURBOMOLE. The RI approximation is used to reduce the computational cost associated with calculating MO integrals.\bibnote{For a detail description of the RI approximation and explicit correlation, see Ref.~\protect\citenum{OterodelaRoza2017}, Chapter 4.} A total of 31 different DFT-based methods with nearly complete 6-311+G(3df,3pd) and moderate 6-31+G(2d,2p) basis sets were tested both by single-point energy calculations on the benchmark structures. Geometry optimization calculations starting from the benchmark structures were also performed for three of the best performing DFT-based method, in order to verify their ability to capture the minimum energy bound structures.

To test the effects of metal cations on HAT barrier heights, calculations were first performed for the reactions not involving metal cations. Geometry optimizations were performed at the M05-2X\cite{Zhao2006}/6-31+G$^{**}$ level of theory. Transition state (TS) structures were obtained by first freezing the abstraction donor-hydrogen-acceptor bond lengths with multiple initial orientations. The frozen bonds were then relaxed to obtain the final TS structures, which were then used to identify the appropriate pre- and post-reaction complexes. All structures were subjected to harmonic vibrational frequency calculations, which were visualized using the Chemcraft program\cite{ccraft} to verify minima (or saddle-points with a single imaginary frequency connecting reactants to products for TS structures). Single-point energy calculations were performed at the M05-2X/6-311+G(2d,2p) level of theory. The effects of MeCN solvent were estimated by inclusion of the SMD\cite{Marenich2009} continuum solvent model in single-point energy calculations.

The inclusion of metal cations into the TS structures proved to be technically challenging. It was my expectation that I could simply include metal cations and necessary counter-anions into the minimum energy complex structures and re-optimize, however this was not the case. TS structures were once again obtained by constrained optimization with the inclusion of the metal cation and counter-anion and freezing the abstraction donor-hydrogen-acceptor bond lengths, providing a guess TS structure. However, in most cases the force constants (which are necessary for a TS optimization calculation) from the guess TS structure were not representative of the true TS structure, thus force constants were recalculated for every step along the optimization, using the ``CalcAll'' keyword in Gaussian. This is a very computationally expensive procedure. Even using this method, many TS structures including metal cations failed to converge. Therefore, guess TS structures which contain a single imaginary frequency connecting reactants to products are used in place. This technique provides genuine TS structures, although they may not be the most stabile TS structure. Nonetheless, the guess TS structure can be used provide an estimate of the reaction barrier height which are verified with calculations that were successful. Where available final TS structures were used to identify the appropriate pre- and post-reaction complexes.

Natural bond order (NBO) and natural population analysis (NPA) were utilized in order to investigate the electronic structures involved in the HAT reactions and the effects of metal cation binding.\cite{Reed1983, Reed1985, Glendening2012} Version 3.1 of the NBO software package,\cite{NBO3} as implemented in the Gaussian 09 package was used in all cases.\cite{Frisch2009} NBO analysis provides a means for estimating the physical effects of chemically intuitive orbital interactions while NPA charges are a reliable means for calculating the occupancies and charges of atomic centres.\cite{Landis2014, Weinhold2016}

\section{Benchmarking DFT based methods for the binding of alkali and alkaline earth metals to organic substrates and oxygen centred radicals}
\sectionmark{Benchmarking DFT based methods}
\label{sec:benchmark}

In order to confidently perform quantum mechanical mechanistic studies, the method of choice must be confidently calibrated. While DFT-based methods have been widely applied to these studied, few studies have previously investigated alkali and alkaline earth-metal cation binding to organic substrates.\cite{Corral2003, Suarez2011, Siu2001, Baldauf2013} Most importantly, benchmark quality data for a wide variety of metals binding to biologically relevant substrates and oxygen-centred radicals does not exist to calibrate DFT-based methods. Therefore, I proposed a benchmark study which incorporated all the biologically relevant alkali and alkaline earth-metal cations, models for dipeptides including amino acid side chains, oxygen-centred radicals, and solvents which are utilized in the experimental mechanistic studies involved in probing these systems. Unfortunately, due to computational restrictions (\emph{vide infra}), benchmark quality calculations on the originally proposed benchmark set were not possible. Full details of the originally proposed benchmark set are in Appendix~\ref{ap:hat},~\ref{fig:ap-set1}.

Benchmark quality binding energies are generally calculated using the ``gold standard'' approach, CCSD(T)/CBS, where correlation consistent basis sets\cite{Marshall2011, Rezac2013} (cc-pV\emph{X}Z, \emph{X}=T,Q,5) developed by Dunning and\cite{Vydrov2006, Vydrov2006a} co-workers are used for complete basis set extrapolation. These basis sets have limited availability for the metals of interest. Specifically, basis sets for K are not available, and only non-augmented basis sets for Li, Na, Mg, and Ca. It is necessary to include core-correlation of at least the first core shell in alkali and alkaline earth metals, thus it would be appropriate to use core valence basis sets such as cc-pCV$X$Z.\cite{Peterson2002} However, these basis sets are even more limited. Therefore, I originally chose the augmented version of the polarization consistent basis sets of Jensen and co-workers\cite{Jensen2001, Jensen2002, Jensen2002a, Jensen2003}  (aug-pc-\emph{N}, \emph{N}=2,3,4), which have been shown to converge to the CBS limit systematically\cite{Kupka2007} and are available for all the elements of interest.

While performing CCSD(T)/CBS calculations, I observed that the metal cations (and neutral metal atoms), did not converge smoothly to the complete basis set limit. As a consequence, complete basis set extrapolation is not feasible. In light of this problem, I decided to re-evaluate the size scope of the benchmark set being used. In order to facilitate future DFT-based work and probe the issue of basis set convergence of alkali and alkaline earth metals, a benchmark set of small substrates was proposed. This new set is shown in \ref{fig:set2}. The new, small benchmark set was selected to include important functional groups and radicals found biological systems, and one of the most common solvents used in physical organic experiments, acetonitrile.

  \label{fig:pes_metals}
\end{figure}

In order to perform complete basis set (CBS) extrapolation, the total energy of a molecule/atom should converge smoothly to the CBS limit.\cite{Truhlar1998} However,~\ref{fig:pes_metals} shows the poor basis set convergence of CCSD(T,Full)/aug-pc$N$ ($N$=1,2,3,4) calculations for alkali and alkaline earth-metals. The energy of each ion relative to the smallest basis set is shown. For \ch{Li^+} the value appears to converge reasonably, however this because there are only 2 electrons in this ion. For all of \ch{Na^+}, \ch{Mg^{2+}}, \ch{K^+}, and \ch{Ca^{2+}}, there appears to be no convergence to the CBS limit as each line continues down linearly. This is problematic as it means that CBS extrapolation would result in a significant degree of uncertainty in the estimated CBS limit total energy.

The poor convergence was thought to be a result of poorly suited basis sets to full core-correlation. However, the same CCSD(T,Full) calculations using the core-correlation (cc-pCV$N$Z) basis sets as show unsatisfactory convergence for \ch{Na^+} and \ch{Mg^{2+}} (See Appendix~\ref{ap:hat}, ~\ref{fig:ap_pes_metals}). Therefore, I was tasked with finding a method which would give results which best approximate alkali and alkaline metal binding at the complete basis set limit. I decided to use an explicitly correlated CCSD(T) treatment known as ``F12$^*$'' to more rapidly approach the CBS limit.\cite{Tenno2012} I tested both the core-correlation consistent basis set developed for used with explicitly correlation (cc-pCV$X$Z-F12),\cite{Peterson2008} and the Ahlrich basis sets (Def2-SVP,-TZVPPD, and -QZVPPD).\cite{Rappoport2010} Both these basis sets combined with the CCSD(T,Full)-F12$^*$ methodology gave satisfactory convergence to the CBS limit for the sodium and magnesium ion (See Appendix ~\ref{ap:hat},~\ref{fig:ap_metals_explicit}) for the convergence of all metal ions calculated with the CCSD(T,Full-F12$^*$/Def2-QZVPPD method). Given that Def2-QZVPPD is available for almost every atom on the periodic table, and the observed convergence to the CBS limit, this basis set was selected for benchmark quality binding energies.

To the best of my knowledge, there is no precedent for extrapolating the Ahlrich basis sets, thus the final benchmark energies are at the CCSD(T)-F12$^*$/Def2-QZVPPD level of theory without extrapolation. The convergence of the total energies of the cations can be estimated as the sum of the experimental ionization energies of the ions. These results are listed in~\ref{tab:metal-energy}. The calculated values are in too high (i.e., not at the CBS limit), and deviate from experiment from 0.16 and 0.66 AU (4.4--18 eV). Deviations of this magnitude are rather significant, but can likely be accounted for by cumulative experimental error, as the experimental ionization energies range from 4--5500 eV. Therefore, the calculated binding energies herein are likely the best available approximation to the gas-phase metal-substrate binding energy.

Some general trends are that alkaline earth-metals bind more strongly than alkali earth-metals. In general the order of binding follows the Lewis acidity of the metal ions: \ch{Mg^{2+}} $>$ \ch{Ca^{2+}} $>$ \ch{Li^+} $>$ \ch{Na^+} $>$ \ch{K^+}. Also, the metals all appear to bind most strongly to the amidic oxygen-centre, reflecting the higher Lewis basicity. All the metals also bind weakest to the oxygen-centred radicals, with greater binding to \ch{HOO^.} as compared to \ch{HO^.}.

Given the magnitude of the binding energies, the overall agreement between the benchmark values and the DFT-based method values with both moderate and large basis sets is very good. Interestingly, the application of the empirical D3(BJ) dispersion correction systematically decreases agreement with benchmark values as it increases over-binding. Also, going from moderate to large basis sets systematically increases the predicted binding energies, as indicated by an increase in MSE across the board. I chose three of the best performing methods (BMK-D3(BJ), TPSS-D3(BJ), and M05-2X) and performed geometry optimizations with moderate basis sets on the benchmark structures to determine if the choice of method would significantly impact the minimum energy bound structure. These results are listed in~\ref{tab:ccsd-metal-opt}.

\begin{table}

Mean absolute error (MAE) values are in \kcalmol\ and average root mean squared deviation (RMSD)\bibnote{Root mean square deviation was calculated using the Kabsch algorithm\protect\cite{Kabsch1976} as implemented in the rmsd package available on GitHub (Calculate RMSD for two XYZ structures, GitHub, http://github.com/charnley/rmsd, accessed Nov. 18, 2016)} of geometry are in \AA.}\label{tab:ccsd-metal-opt}
  \begin{tabular}{l c c c}
    Method & MAE(SP) & MAE(Relaxed) & Average RMSD \\
    \hline
    BMK-D3(BJ) & 1.02 & 1.24 & 0.012 \\
    M05-2X & 1.24 & 1.17 & 0.020 \\
    TPSS-D3(BJ) & 1.25 & 1.21 & 0.026 \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

For all the three methods tested, the average of the root mean square deviations from benchmark structures are very small (0.012--0.026 \AA). For BMK-D3(BJ), re-optimization of the structures results in a slight increase in MAE, while for TPSS-D3(BJ) and M05-2X, the opposite is true. As a whole, it seems that DFT-based methods are capable of capturing alkali and alkaline metal ion binding with organic substrates and molecules. M05-2X appears to be one of the best performing DFT-based methods. Additionally, M05-2X is recommended by the QM-ORSA\cite{Galano2013} method, which outlines best principles for calculating accurate HAT rate constants in solution. And finally, M05-2X was previously used by our group in the study of the HAT reaction between DMSO and \bno,\cite{vanSanten2016} thus I have selected this method for further study of the effects of alkali and alkaline earth metal cations on the barrier heights of HAT reactions. Note also that M05-2X is a hybrid density-functional with 56\% HF-exchange, and thus should not suffer from delocalization error.

\section{Exploring the nature of metal cation substrate interactions}

The first step to understanding the effect non-redox active metal have on HAT reaction barrier heights is investigating the nature of the binding interaction. \ref{fig:pes-dma-na}A,B show the potential energy surfaces (PESs) of the binding of sodium ion, and sodium chloride to DMA, respectively. There are three surfaces in each plot representing the same potential energy surface in the gas-phase (black circles), and in a continuum solvent field of (grey squares) or water (white circles). For both sodium ion and sodium chloride, the gas-phase PES demonstrates severe over-binding with respect to a realistic system. This is indicated by a much deeper well than both solvents and a long range interaction that does not tail off within a reasonable distance. This simply underscores the importance of including solvent effects in studying the effects of metal cations. Intestingly, for the effects of differnt solvent appears to be quite small. In both cases the difference between the mininum of the water PES is about 2.5 \kcalmol, while the differences in range of interaction is neglible. Furthermore, the minimum of the PES well in all cases falls at about the same distance (2.1--2.2 \AA) in the gas-phase and in both solvents. The small differences in binding interactions indicate that the effects as measured in MeCN should also apply to the more biologically relevant aqueous system. Furthermore, Ingold and Litwinienko have shown that \ch{C-H} abstraction by oxygen-centred radicals does not depend strongly on solvent.\cite{Litwinienko2007}

For both the ion and the salt of sodium, the binding interaction approaches zero well before 5 \AA, or the size of the first solvation shell of the sodium ion.\cite{Degreve1996} This result is consistent with literature that studies the Hofmeister series, where it has been shown that biologically relavant cations are only able to influence their immediate solvation shell.\cite{Omta2003, Funkner2011} Furthermore, \citet{Heyda2009} utilized molecular dynamics simulations of $N$-methylacetamide in aqueous solutions of NaCl, NaBr, KCl, and KBr to obtained radial distribution functions (RDFs). The RDFS are in agree with the the calculated PESs in that the most probable distance to find \ch{Na^+} from the amidic oxygen-centre is at about 2--2.5 \AA separation. Heyda et al. also showed that \ch{Na^+} preferentially binds with the amide as compared to \ch{K^+}, and that the nature of the halide counteranion is unimportant in the interaction. From these results it is possible an important conclusion: The use of \ch{Cl-} in the calculations should reasonable reflect the trends observed by Salamone et al. with \ch{ClO4-} and \ch{OTf-}.

\ref{fig:pes-dma-mg}A,B show the PESs of the binding of magnesium ion, and magnesium chloride to DMA, respectively. As is the case for \ch{Na^+}, the gas-phase PES of\ch{Mg^{2+}} is extremely over-bound, so much so infact, that the interation does not approach zero. At an O--Mg distance of 12 \AA, there is calculated binding interaction of -48.5 \kcalmol, which is actually greater than at 6 \AA by about 5 \kcalmol. The unphysical behaviour is a prime example of a failing of DFT-based methods. Here, the DFT calculations are unable to localize the charge properly due to delocalization error,\cite{Cohen2008} even with the use of a high-percentage HF hybrid density functional. The localization of charges was recently described by \citet{Cheng2016} as a widespread failing of every DFT-based method they tested. The reason this is a problem with \ch{Mg^{2+}} and not \ch{Na^+} has to do with the ionization potentials (IP) of the metals with respect to that of DMA. The expermental IP\cite{Slifkin1967, Baldwin1977, CRC2016} of DMA is 8.8--9.2 eV, the first IP of Na is 5.1 eV, and the second IP of Mg is 15.0 eV (calculated with M05-2X/6-311+G(2d,2p) = 8.9, 5.0, and 14.9 eV, respectively). Then, the ionization of DMA by \ch{Na^+} and \ch{Mg^{2+}} can be described as:

\begin{align*}
\ch{DMA + Mg^2+ -> DMA^+ + Mg^+} \quad  &\Delta E = -6 \mathrm{eV} \\
\ch{DMA + Na^+ -> DMA^+ + Na} \quad &\Delta E = +4 \mathrm{eV}
\end{align*}

The ionization of DMA by \ch{Mg^2+} is favourable by about 6 eV, and unfavourable by \ch{Na+} by about 4 eV. In a real system, magnesium ions exist invariably in the +2 oxidation state. DFT-based methods prefer to delocalize the charge, resulting in non-physical binding between DMA and \ch{Mg^2+}, but not for \ch{Na+}. A possible resolution to this is to used a constrained DFT method which enables one to specify atomic occupancies,\cite{Melander2016} however this technique is not currently available in most common quantum chemical packages.

\end{figure}

The inclusion of MeCN and water solvent appear at first glance to alleviate this problem. Note however that both PESs cross over zero binding at about 3 \kcalmol\, indicating there is still delocalization. Additionally, for magnesium chloride in the gas-phase, there also appears to be delocalization error occuring, as evident by the PES crossing zero just below 4 \kcalmol. On the other hand, the inclusion of either water or MeCN solvent with \ch{MgCl2} give reasonable PESs with a binding interaction of about 25 \kcalmol\ for both water and MeCN, and a tailing off at about 3 \AA, or slightly larger than the size of the first hydration shell of \ch{Mg^2+} (ca. 2\AA).\cite{Chatterjee2013} Therefore, the effects of magnesium on HAT reaction barrier may possibly using \ch{MgCl2}, however to avoid further complications, I have elected to focus only on sodium for future considerations.

Next, I performed calculations to determine if the interaction of metal cations systematically increase the bond strengths of \ch{C-H} bonds by decreasing hyperconjugative overlap between neighbouring $\pi$-systems and \ch{C-H} $\sigma^*$ anti-bonding orbitals. The BDEs for several substrates in the presence of \ch{Na^+} and \ch{NaCl} are listed in~\ref{tab:bde-metal}. The ROCBS-QB3 BDEs for each of the substrates is included to demonstrate that the relative order of BDEs for substrates with multiple \ch{C-H} bonds is reasonable. The BDE for an arbitrary metal substrate complex (\ch{M\bond{dotted}X-H}) can be calculated as:

\begin{equation}
BDE = E(\ch{M\bond{dotted}X^.}) + E(\ch{H^.}) - E(\ch{M\bond{dotted}X-H})

For DMA, the $N$-methyl groups cis and trans relative to the carbonyl are the weakest and therefore most thermodynamically favourable. Furthermore, \citet{Salamone2013} showed that both \bno\ and \cumo\ prefer to abstract from the $N$-methyl groups of DMA, rather than the acetyl group. The inclusion of \ch{Na^+} increases the cis BDE by 1.0 \kcalmol\ and the trans BDE by 1.2 \kcalmol, while \ch{NaCl} increases the cis BDE by 1.8 \kcalmol\ and the trans BDE by 1.0 \kcalmol. From the NBO analysis, the average hyperconjugative weakening for the $N$-methyl \ch{C-H} bonds is 5.6 and 5.9 \kcalmol\ for the cis and trans positions, respectively. The inclusion of \ch{Na^+} decreases the weakening to the 3.7 and 4.1 \kcalmol, while \ch{NaCl} decreases the weakening to 5.4 and 5.5 \kcalmol\ for the cis and trans positions respectively. Therefore, the decrease in bond strengthening effect in going from \ch{Na^+} to \ch{NaCl} does not fully reflect the change in hyperconjugative bond weakening. The differences can be ascribed to effects from charge transfer which differentially stabilize the parent and radical complexes of DMA. Additionally the calculated cis-DMA BDE increases with \ch{NaCl}, which is due an destabilizing hydrogen-bond like interaction between the \ch{Cl^-} and the acetyl methyl group of the cis-methyl radical of DMA. \ref{fig:dma-na-cl}a-d shown the structures of DMA-NaCl and the three radicals, and it can be seen in~\ref{fig:dma-na-cl}c that the cis radical complex is the only structure with an interaction between DMA and \ch{Cl^-}. One possible reason for this difference is a stronger repulsive interaction between the cis radical and the \ch{Cl^-}, as compared to the other radicals.

Interestingly, the predicted BDE for the acetyl radical of DMA decreases with both \ch{Na^+} and \ch{NaCl}. This can be attributed to the change in electronic structure associated with complexation. Consider the two possible resonance forms of DMA shown in ~\ref{fig:dma-res}. Normally, the two forms contribute roughly equally to the overall electronic structure of DMA so that there is a net bond order of 1.5 between the C and O and the C and N. The complexation of DMA to \ch{Na^+} slightly increases the contribution of the zwitterionic form, resulting in a decrease in electron density at the carbonyl carbon. This is evidenced by the increase in NPA charge at the carbonyl from +0.72 in DMA to +0.74 in the DMA-\ch{Na^+} complex. The positively-charged carbon centre inductively withdraws electron density, stabilizing the acetyl radical and decreasing the effective BDE. The amidic nitrogen becomes net more positive, but still has an NPA charge which is negative, and so there is no inductive stabilization effect for the $N$-methyl radicals.

\end{figure}

For MeCN and DMSO the complexation of either \ch{Na^+} or \ch{NaCl} results in a decrease in \ch{C-H} BDE. In MeCN, the hyperconjugative overlap between the \ch{C+N} $\pi$-system and the \ch{C-H} $\sigma^*$ anti-bonding orbital decreases as a result of the interaction between \ch{Na^+} and the nitrogen centre. DMSO has a non-Lewis structure, however there is normally a nominal hyperconjugative overlap between the sulphur centre and the \ch{C-H} $\sigma^*$ anti-bonding orbitals. This overlap decreases as a result of the interaction of \ch{Na^+} with the oxygen-centre of DMSO.

Upon complexation of \ch{Na+} of \ch{NaCl}, the BDEs of the more sterically bulky amide substrate DIA follow the same trend that is observed as for DMA: The acetyl \ch{C-H} BDE decreases due to inductive stabilization, while the \ch{C-H} bonds $\alpha$ to the amidic nitrogen centre increase as a result of decreased hyperconjugative overlap. Alkoxyl radicals are not expected to abstract from \ch{C-H} bonds $\beta$ to the nitrogen centre in DIA or other longer chain $N$-alkyl amides, as the incipient radical is not stabilized by amidic $\pi$-system. However, that due to steric repulsion, the $\alpha$-radicals of DIA cannot lie directly in the $\pi$-plane. As such the $\alpha$-\ch{C-H} BDEs of DIA are greater than those of DMA, and are closer to the $\beta$-\ch{C-H} BDEs than perhaps expected. The effects of sodium binding to the amidic oxygen are almost nil for the $\beta$-trans C-H bond of DIA, however there is a significant decrease in the $\beta$-cis \ch{C-H} BDE. Figure~\ref{fig:dia-na-cl}a,b shows the structures of the DIA-NaCl complex and the $\beta$-cis radical complex, where it can seen that the metal cation interacts with both the oxygen-centre and the carbon-centred radical. This interaction stabilizes the radical complex and thus decrease the effective BDE, however this interaction is likely not possible in the TS structure and is not expected to effect to effective BDE in a HAT reaction.

All of these results together confirm that specific metal-substrate interactions can increase the effect BDEs of abstractable \ch{C-H} bonds by decreasing hyperconjugative overlap. However, this is complicated by the possibility for secondary interactions between the metal or counter-anion. Furthermore, additional factors such as induction can alter the effects. It appears that for \ch{C-H} bonds $\alpha$ to electron-rich species which hyperconjugatively overlap with the $\sigma^*$ anti-bonding orbital, the complexation of non-redox active metals increases the effective \ch{C-H} bond strength. However, if the \ch{C-H} bond is adjacent to an electron-poor centre, such as the carbon of a carbonyl, metal complexation actually decreases the bond strength slightly. In the context of HAT reaction barrier heights, increasing the effective \ch{C-H} bond strength should decrease the reaction-rate slightly by destabilizing the TS complex. However, there are other important factors to consider such as polarity in the TS complex. Furthermore, it is important to note that experiments showed that \ch{NaClO4} did not significantly effect the HAT rate constants for reactions between \cumo\ and organic substrates. Therefore, the effects observed herein likely are an exaggeration of what is truly occurring in situ. Nonetheless, these theoretical calculations may be useful in developing an understanding of the subtle nature of the effects of non-redox active metal cations on HAT reactions in general.

\section{HAT reactions involving non-redox active metals}

\subsection{DMA}

Hydrogen abstraction reactions involving the oxygen-centred radicals \bno\ and \cumo\ and DMA in MeCN have been previously investigated experimentally and theoretically.\cite{Salamone2013} The HAT reaction between DMA and \bno\ was determined to occur dominantly through a direct HAT mechanism from the $N$-methyl group cis relative to the carbonyl, and is kinetically limited by the formation of a strong pre-reaction complex between the relatively acid $\alpha$-C-H of \bno\ and the amidic oxygen centre. On the other hand, \cumo\ cannot form a strong hydrogen-bonding interaction, and thus can form a non-specific dispersion-bound pre-reaction complexes. Abstraction by \cumo\ still takes place from one of the $N$-methyl groups, but the rate constant is 2 orders of magnitude less than for \bno. Furthermore, the inclusion of metal salts in reactions of DMA with \cumo\ were previously investigated.\cite{Salamone2015metals}\jnote{complete}

Herein, I have calculated the reaction barrier heights for all three abstractable positions of DMA for HAT reactions involving \cumo\ and \bno, both with and without \ch{NaCl}. These data are summarized in~\ref{tab:DMA-dG}. The free energy barriers calculated at the M05-2X-SMD(MeCN)/6-311+G(2d,2p)//M05-2X/6-31+G$^{**}$ are systematically higher than those previously calculated by about 8.5 \kcalmol.\cite{Salamone2013} The reason for this is unclear, given that M05-2X has previously been used successfully to calculate accurate HAT rate constants.\cite{Galano2013} However, the relative ranking and energies for the reaction barrier heights for the different \ch{C-H} bonds are appropriate. Therefore, although these results cannot be used to predict rate constants, they are useful for studying the change in barrier height due to the addition of NaCl.

Focussing first on the barrier heights for HAT between DMA and \cumo, the results of complexation with \ch{NaCl} is variable. For each of the acetyl, cis, and trans \ch{C-H} bond positions of DMA, there are three different effects upon complexation of \ch{NaCl}. For the trans position, both the free energy and enthalpic barriers increase, for the cis position the free energy barrier increases and the enthalpic barrier decreases, and for the acetyl position both the free energy and enthalpic barriers decrease. The reason for this relies on examining the TS structures, which are shown in~\ref{fig:dma-cumo-ts}a-f.

\end{figure}

For the TS structure representing abstraction from the trans position (relative to the carbonyl) \ch{C-H} bond of DMA by \cumo\ (\ref{fig:dma-cumo-ts}a), there is a calculated 0.3 \kcalmol\ increase in $\Delta H^\ddagger$, which is somewhat less than the predicted increase in BDE of 1.0 \kcalmol. This difference can be ascribed as due to the effect of charge transfer: NPA indicates a 0.04 $e^-$ transfer from DMA to \ch{Na^+}. Furthermore, TSs for HAT between \ch{C-H} bond and oxygen-centred radicals are characterized by a degree of charge separation.\cite{Roberts1999} NPA indicates that in the trans position TS structure excluding \ch{NaCl} the charge separation is 0.24 $e^-$, but the charge separation increases with the inclusion of \ch{NaCl} to 0.26 $e^-$. This increased charge separation results in a lower enthalpic barrier than expected solely on the basis of the increase in \ch{C-H} BDE. By increasing charge separation in the TS structure, it becomes easier to abstract the hydrogen atom as it increases the proton-transfer like character. The increase in $\Delta G^\ddagger$ is 3.0 \kcalmol, indicating that the complexation of metal cations increases the entropic penalty in forming the TS structure, or in other words the TS is tighter than in the absence of metal cations.

In abstraction of the cis position \ch{C-H} bond of DMA by \cumo, there is a calculated 2.6 \kcalmol\ decrease in $\Delta H^\ddagger$ and an increase of 0.9 \kcalmol\ in $\Delta G^\ddagger$. The decrease in enthalpic barrier is inconsistent with the predicted increase in BDE of 1.8 \kcalmol\ upon complexation with \ch{NaCl}. The TS structure in~\ref{fig:dma-cumo-ts}c shows a possible long range interaction between \ch{Na^+} and the aromatic ring of \cumo which draws electron density and increases the reactivity. Additionally, NPA predicts a 0.07 $e^-$ charge transfer between DMA and \ch{Na^+}. The combination of these two factors stabilizes the TS and decreases $\Delta H^\ddagger$. The entropic penalty associated with complexation of \ch{NaCl} results in an increase in free energy barrier.

Abstraction by \cumo\ from the acetyl \ch{C-H} bond of DMA was previously described as being a minor reaction pathway.\cite{Salamone2013} In light of the reduction in BDE at the acetyl position of amides, it may be reasonable to expect the reaction barrier to decrease. This indeed appears to be the net effect of complexation of \ch{NaCl} to DMA, as $\Delta H^\ddagger$ decreases by 3.1 \kcalmol\ and $\Delta G^\ddagger$ decreases by 0.6 \kcalmol. \ref{fig:dma-cumo-ts}f shows that in the TS structure, \ch{Na^+} interacts with the aromatic system of \cumo, which also stabilizes the TS and decreases the barrier.

For HAT between DMA and \bno, the interaction between \ch{NaCl} and \bno, are stronger owing to the shorter distance between \ch{Na^+} and the centre of the aromatic ring, as shown in~\ref{fig:dma-bno-ts}a-f. This shorter distance is likely possible due to the easier rotation of DMA relative to \bno, as compared to \cumo. As a result, the enthalpic barriers for the abstraction from DMA by \bno\ decrease as a result of complexation of \ch{NaCl} for both the acetyl and trans position \ch{C-H} bonds. For the cis position \ch{C-H} bond of DMA however, the enthalpic barrier increases. This can be explained on the basis of the presence of an interaction between \ch{Cl^-} and the $\alpha$\ch{C-H} bond of \bno. While \ch{Na^+} withdraws electron density from the aromatic system of \bno, \ch{Cl^-} is able to donate electron density back to \bno, counteracting the effect of the interaction of \ch{Na^+}. As a result, the enthalpic barrier increases as expected on the basis of the increase of the cis position \ch{C-H} BDE of DMA.

For both \cumo\ and \bno, the presence of possible secondary interactions between \ch{NaCl} and the radicals obfuscates the results. Therefore, in order to determine if non-redox active metal cations may act as chemo-protective agents in biological systems, I have performed calculated involving the more biologically relevant \ch{HO^.} radical. Although there is no literature value for $k_H$ of the HAT reaction between DMA and \ch{HO^.}, I have used the Snelgrove-Ingold equation\cite{Snelgrove2001} to estimate the rate constant as 1.5\E{10} \Ms, which is two and five orders of magnitude greater than \bno\ and \cumo, respectively. Unfortunately, I was unsuccessful in performing full optimization calculations in the presence of the metal salt. However, the ``guess'' TS structures obtained by freezing the hydrogen atom acceptor donor bonds (as described in the methods section) herein represent approximated transition state structures and therefore provide an estimate of the effects of metal salts in a more biologically relevant model. The calculated reaction barriers are presented in~\ref{tab:dma-oh}.

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

For the direct HAT reaction between \ch{OH^.} and DMA abstraction occurs primarily from the cis position \ch{C-H} bond of DMA. The calculated free energy (enthalpic) barrier is 7.9(-2.7) \kcalmol, which gives a calculated rate constant of 1.0 \E{7} \Ms, or three orders of magnitude lower than the predicted rate constants of 1.5 \E{10} \Ms. This result in unsurprising given the poor agreement of HAT reaction between DMA and \bno\ and \cumo. The complexation of \ch{NaCl} to DMA increases the estimated free energy reaction barriers across the board by 4.2--7.7 \kcalmol, suggesting that if \ch{Na^+} interacts closely with DMA in vivo, then non-redox active metals may have a chemo-protective effect against hydrogen abstraction by \ch{HO^.}.

For the acetyl position \ch{C-H} bond of DMA, the enthalpic barrier increases by 1.5 \kcalmol, even though the calculated BDE decreases slightly upon complexation of \ch{NaCl}. This can once again be explained by the effects of charge transfer in the TS complex. For the TS structure representing direct HAT between \ch{HO^.} the acetyl position of DMA-NaCl, there is a calculated charge transfer from DMA to \ch{Na^+} of 0.02 $e^-$, which results in a decrease in charge separation between \ch{HO^.} and DMA from 0.26 $e^-$ without \ch{NaCl} to 0.25 $e^-$ with \ch{NaCl}. Although this effect is small, it appears to significantly effect the ability of \ch{HO^.} to abstract a hydrogen atom from DMA. The same argument applies to both the cis and trans \ch{C-H} bond positions of DMA, for which the enthalpic barrier increases by more than the calculated change in BDE.

\subsection{DIA}

Next, to study the effect steric bulk has on the HAT reactions between amides and oxygen-centred radical, I have performed a study of HAT between DIA and \cumo. The HAT reaction between DIA and \cumo was previously studied by \citet{Salamone2014}, however only the $\alpha$-N-alkyl positions were studied theoretically. Since the BDEs for $\alpha$- and $\beta$-N-alkyl \ch{C-H} positions are relatively close in energy, I calculated the reaction barriers for these positions as well. The calculated free energy (enthalpic) barriers excluding and including \ch{NaCl} are listed in~ref{tab:dia-cumo}. Interestingly the predicted reaction barriers for abstraction of the $\beta$ positions of DIA are lower than the $\alpha$ positions. By applying the Boltzmann distribution about 73\% of abstractions by \cumo\ from DIA will take place from either the cis- or trans-$\beta$ positions of DIA. Therefore, abstraction from bulky amides by bulky oxygen-centred radicals are likely controlled by steric considerations. Note also that many of the TS optimizations were not successful with the inclusion of \ch{NaCl} and in which case ``guess'' TS structures have been used to estimate the barrier heights.

\subsection{Strong hydrogen bond accepting substates}

In the investigation of the effects of metal cations on HAT reactions between DMA and \cumo\ Salamone et al. demonstrated that in DMSO solvent, HAT reactivity is not significantly effected by the addition of metal salts.\cite{Salamone2015metals} This can be explained on the basis of the stronger Lewis basicity of DMSO as as compared to DMA, resulting in the competitive binding of \ch{M^n+} to DMSO over DMA. The rate constant for HAT between DMSO and \cumo\ is 1.8 \E{4} \Ms\ while that for DMSO and \cumo\ is 1.2 \E{6} \Ms\ in MeCN solvent at 298 K, therefore only small changes in $k_{obs}$ are expected for HAT between \cumo\ and DMA in DMSO solvent with metal salts. I am interested in how metal salts effect the HAT reactivity of DMSO and other related strong hydrogen bond accepting substrates. We previously showed that DMSO and \bno\ react via an ``alternative'' HAT reaction, where \bno\ acts at the hydrogen atom donor rather than acceptor. The net reaction yields benzaldehyde, dimethyl sulfide, and \ch{HO^.} as the DMSO-H radical decomposes in a concerted manner following the alternative HAT TS. \cumo lacks the acidic $\alpha$-\ch{C-H} bond to donate, and therefore can only undergo conventional HAT. I performed computational studies to determined if metal cations could effect this reactivity and if the related (HMPA and TBPO) substrates displayed similar reactivity.

Focus first of the reactions of DMSO with \cumo\ and \bno\ in the presence of \ch{NaCl}. The reactions studied are shown in~\ref{fig:dmso-rxn} and the calculated free energy (enthalpic) barriers are listed in~\ref{tab:dmso-dG}. Also, the TS structures for the reactions in~\ref{fig:dmso-rxn} are shown in~\ref{fig:dmso-ts}a-f. Firstly, for HAT between DMSO and \cumo\ in the presence of \ch{NaCl} (Reaction 1,~\ref{fig:dmso-ts}b), the free energy barrier increases by 1.5 \kcalmol\, however the enthalpic barrier decreases by 3.7 \kcalmol. This can be explained in a similar manner to the reactions of DMA: \ch{Na^+} interacts both with the oxygen of DMSO and the aromatic system of \cumo, resulting in a stabilization of the TS and a decrease in enthalpic barrier in spite of a predicted increase in \ch{C-H} BDE. This binding however results in a tighter TS structure, thus the entropic cost increases and so does the $\Delta G^\ddagger$.

Next, for the of the alternative HAT between DMSO and \bno\ in the presence of \ch{NaCl} (Reaction 2,~\ref{fig:dmso-ts}d) the free energy barrier increases as a result of complexation. This is a result of the entropic penalty of binding as $\Delta H^\ddagger$ decreases by 1.2 \kcalmol\ due to the interaction of \ch{Na^+} with DMSO and the aromatic ring of \bno. In this TS structure excluding \ch{NaCl} there is some charge separation, however, DMSO (the acceptor) has a partial positive charge and \bno\ (the donor) has a partial negative charge. This is contrary to typical HAT reactions between oxygen-centred radicals and \ch{C-H} bonds where in the TS structure, the donor typically has a partial positive charge and the acceptor has a partial positive charge. Therefore, the significant reduction in charge separation from 0.25 $e^-$ to 0.11 $e^-$ appears to play a lesser role. The alternative HAT reaction is likely driven by the concerted cleavage of the \ch{S-O} bond of DMSO-H.

While the conventional HAT reaction between DMSO and \bno\ is unlikely to occur as the barrier is ca. 12 \kcalmol higher than the alternative reaction, it is still interesting to consider the effect that \ch{NaCl} has on the reaction barrier height. \ref{fig:dmso-ts}f shows that in the TS structure for the conventional HAT reaction between DMSO and \bno\ in the presence of \ch{NaCl}, there is a relatively close interaction with both the oxygen of DMSO and the aromatic ring of \bno. As a result, the free energy (enthalpic) barrier decreases by 0.6(5.2) \kcalmol. NPA estimates a relatively large (as compared to the DMA HAT reactions) 0.10 $e^-$ charge transfer from DMSO to \ch{Na^+}, resulting in a decrease in charge separation in the TS structure from 0.27 $e^-$ to 0.21 $e^-$.
