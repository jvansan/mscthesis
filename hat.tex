\section{Benchmarking Density Functional Theory for the Binding of
  Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals}

In order to study the central hypothesis propsed in this work, we must carefully
select a computational method. In particular, we wish to use density-functional
theory (DFT), which is known to be prone to various problems such as
self-interaction error \cite{Dutoi2006}, delocalization
error,\cite{OterodelaRoza2014} and the inability to treat non-covalent
interactions.\cite{Johnson2009,DiLabio2016} The latter of these can be corrected
by the selection of a method capable correcting the non-covalent corrections
such as a pair-wise dispersion model \jnote{\textbackslash-cite{D3}}, or atom
centered potentials developed by our group
\jnote{\textbackslash-cite{DCPS}}. Other errors can be ignored through the
careful selection of a DFT method.

We are interested in selecting a method which can accuratetly treat
the interactions between alkali and alkaline earth metal cations, and
organic substrates and radicals. To this end, there exists little
literature, with one notable paper\cite{Suarez2011} which examines the
binding of calcium cations to organic substrates. In this paper,
\citet{Suarez2011} provide accurate energetic, electronic, and
structural results for the binding of calcium to organic neutral and
charged species, as well as assess the performance of four different
DFT methods. They also analyze the nature of ligand-metal bonding
interactions using a symmetry-adapted perturbation theory approach
(SAPT) \jnote{EXPAND ON THIS}

Due to our interest in alkali and alkaline earth metal cations in FHT,
we determined it necessary to prepare benchmark quality data for
binding to organic substrates and radicals.

\jnote{Calcium prefers to bind to O, with binding to S or N is
  rare\cite{Harding1999}} In N,N-dimethylacetamide for example, calcium
  binds preferentially to the lone pairs of the carbonyl oxygen over
  the nitrogen lone pair. This is shown in \ref{fig:DMA-Ca}.

\subsection{Methods}

Conformers were generated using Hyperchem with the AM1 semi-empirical
molecular orbital (MO) method \jnote{\textbackslash-cite{hyperchem}}
followed by optimization calulations of 5-10 lowest energy structures
using at the \jnote{(currently unpublished)} BLYP-D3/pc1 level of
theory, including our own groups basis set incomplete potential
(BSIPs).\jnote{(CITATIONS)}

On the basis of the work by \citet{OterodelaRoza2014}, which showed
that in systems which are halogen bonded, erroneous charge transfer
can be significant, and given the charge on the metal cations, the
LC-$\omega$PBE density functional with D3 dispersion correction and
moderate 6-31+G(2d,2p) \jnote{(CITATIONS for DFT and D3)} basis sets
were applied to determine the most strongly bound complexes of
substrates and metal cations. Global minima monomers and complexes
were optimized with the LC-$\omega$PBE-D3 method near the basis set
limit (6-311+G(3df,3pd).  Highly correlated wavefunction results were
obtained at the CCSD(T) level of theory with extrapolation to the
complete basis set limit.\jnote{CITATION} Calculations were performed
using the Gaussian 09 package\cite{Frisch2009}, and wavefunction
calculations were performed using the TURBOMOLE\cite{turbomole}
package.


\subsection{Benchmark systems}

The purpose of this work is to provide high-level binding energies for
organic substrates which are of interest directly for this project,
but also which may be useful for future work. The substrates proposed
were to be relevant to simple biological models such as dipeptide like
molecules and the hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radical. We also wanted to
incorporate substrates with are important to the physical organic
experiments that are performed to probe these systems, thus solvents
such as acetonitrile and dimethylsulfoxide and the benzyloxyl and
cumyloxyl radicals were also included. This set is shown in
\ref{fig:set1}\jnote{FIND CDX}.

\begin{scheme}[hbt]
  \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/set1}
    \caption{Initial proposed benchmark set of molecules and
      cations. Note this set consistes of all combinations of
      substrates and metal cation, thus there are 60 complexes in the
      set.}
  \label{fig:set1}
\end{scheme}

Benchmark quality binding energies are generally calculated using the
``gold standard'' approach, CCSD(T)/CBS, where correlation consistent
basis sets\jnote{(CITATION)} (cc-pV\emph{X}Z, \emph{X}=T,Q,5)
developed by Dunning and co-workers are used for complete basis set
extrapolation. These basis sets have limited availability for the
metals of interest. Specifically, basis sets for K are note available,
and only non-augmented basis sets for Li, Na, Mg, and Ca. It is
necessary to include core correlation of the n-1 shell in alkali and
alkaline earth metals, thus it is advantageous to use core valence
basis sets such as cc-pCV\emph{X}Z. These basis sets are even more
limitted, thus we opted for the augmented version of the polarization
consistent basis sets of Jensen and co-workers (aug-pc-\emph{N},
\emph{N}=2,3,4). \jnote{CITATIONS FOR GOLD STANDARD AND BASIS SETS,
  NEED THEORY SECTION ON DIFFERENT BASIS SETS}

While performing CCSD(T)/CBS calculations, we notices that the metal
cations (and neutral metal atoms), did not converge smoothly to the
complete basis set limit. Given this, and the limitted computational
resources, we decided to re-evaluate the size scope of the benchmark
set being used. In order to facilitate future DFT work and probe the
issue of basis set convergence of alkali and alkaline earth metals, a
benchmark set of small substrates was proposed. This new set is shown
in \ref{fig:set2}. The new, small benchmark set was selected to
include important functional groups and radicals for biological
systems and the most common solvent used in physical organic
experiments, acetonitrile.

    \caption{Revised benchmark set of small substrates and
      cations. Note this set consistes of all combinations of
      substrates and metal cation, thus there are 35 complexes in the
      set.}
