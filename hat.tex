\chapter{Do non-redox active metal cations have the potentials to behave as
chemo-protective agents? The Effects on Metal Cations on HAT Reaction Barrier
Heights} \label{ch:hat}

\section{Introduction}

Metal cations are ubiquitous in biological systems and play an important role in
biological function. As such, there is a great deal of interest in studying
metals in biological systems. Proteins in particular are often associated with
metals, and in the worldwide Protein Data Bank,\cite{Harding2010, Berman2007}
over one-third of crystal structures contain metals. Redox active metals, such
as copper and iron, act as co-factors in metalloenzymes for important catalytic
processes.\cite{Atkins2010}

Non-redox active metal cations are equally as important in biological function
as redox active metals, where they are essential to protein structure and
function, along with cellular and neuronal signalling.\cite{Karp1999} Sodium and
calcium ions are most abundant extracellularly, while potassium and magnesium
are dominant inside of cells. While specific ionic concentrations vary
dramatically depending on physiological conditions, estimates for equilibrium
concentrations in both mammalian heart cells\cite{Ingwall2006} and blood
plasma\cite{daSilva2001} are listed in~\ref{tab:metalconc}. As sodium and
magnesium are the most abundant alkali and alkaline earth metals found in
biologically relevant systems, they are of prime interest for investigation.

  plasma. Concentrations are in units of mM. Values are rounded to one

\begin{tabular}{l c c}

  \ch{K^+} & 100 & 4 \\
  \ch{Ca^{2+}} & 0.1 & 2
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Extensive crystallographic surveys indicate that metals bind predominantly to
oxygen centres in proteins.\cite{Harding1999, Harding2004, Hsin2008} Divalent
metals are most often found bound directly to proteins. Calcium binds anywhere
from 4 to 6 binding sites in protein crystal structures, while magnesium binds
only 1 or 2. Monovalent metals, on the other hand, are often heavily solvated
and so they appear in solvent cavities of proteins, although sodium or potassium
are sometimes found bound directly to carbonyl or carboxylate oxygen
centres.\cite{Harding2010}

A great deal of research has focussed on \ch{Ca^{2+}} in the context of reactive
oxygen-centred radical production.\cite{Goerlach2015} Specifically, \ch{Ca^{2+}}
ions are important in the mitochondria, where, depending on physiological
conditions and concentrations, they can act as inhibitor or promoters of
free-radical production in the electron transport chain.\cite{AdamVizi2010} One
explanation is that \ch{Ca^{2+}} induce conformational changes of the proteins
involved in the electron transport chain that are responsible for radical
generation.\cite{Brookes2004} Mitochondrial free-radicals, when present in
moderate amounts, can act as cell signalling molecules to activate pro-growth
responses.\cite{Sullivan2014} However, ``dysfunctional'' mitochondria can
produce excess radicals leading to oxidative damage that has been linked to
degenerative diseases.

Given the significant importance alkali and alkaline earth metals play in
biological systems, their impact on protein oxidation must be considered.
However, until recently, kinetic studies of protein oxidation have not
investigated the mechanistic role of non-redox active metals. In a series of
three papers,\cite{Salamone2013a, Salamone2015metals, Salamone2016} Bietti and
colleagues have shown that alkali and alkaline earth metals have an inhibitory
effect on HAT reactions involving \cumo\ and organic substrates. Some of the
experimental rate constants from these papers are summarized
in~\ref{tab:hat-metals}. All rate constants were obtained by time-resolved LFP
in nitrogen or argon-saturated acetonitrile (MeCN) at 298 K, as was previously
described in Section~\ref{sec:hat-methods}. The experimental results have been
rationalized on the basis of Lewis acidic metals cations interactions with Lewis
basic substrates.

Firstly, for hydrocarbons, cyclic ethers, and tertiary amines, \cumo\ hydrogen
abstraction rate constants in the presence of excess concentrations of lithium
and magnesium salts were measured.\cite{Salamone2013a} In the presence of
\ch{LiClO4} and \ch{Mg(ClO4)2}, the rate of abstraction by \cumo\ from
1,4-cyclohexadiene (CHD) increases very slightly. Since CHD has no Lewis basic
centres, the increase in HAT rate constant was explained on the basis of metal
cation interactions with \cumo, very slightly increasing the hydrogen
abstraction ability by withdrawing electron density from the aromatic ring.
Metal cations were also shown to increase the unimolecular decay of \cumo\ by
$\beta$-scission (See Section~\ref{sec:hat-methods}). The largest kinetic effect
was observed with \ch{LiClO4} with $k_\beta$ = 1.8\E{6} $s^{-1}$, which is a
roughly 3-fold increase as compared to the rate in MeCN at 298 K
($k_\beta$\cite{Avila1995} = 6.3\E{5} $s^{-1}$). This effect is significantly
less than the observed kinetic solvent effect on \cumo\ $\beta$-scission
measured in \ch{H2O} or 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol ($k_\beta$ = 1.0\E{7} and
6.1\E{6} $s^{-1}$, respectively).\cite{Bietti2005, Neta1984} Therefore, the
kinetic effects of these alkali and alkaline metal salts interacting via Lewis
acid-base interactions with the oxygen-centre of \cumo\ are less than the
effects of hydrogen-bonding by solvents.

Next, the HAT rate constants for abstraction from tetrahydrofuran (THF) decrease
in the presence of non-redox active metal salts. Both \ch{LiClO4} and \ch{LiOTf}
decrease $k_H$ by a factor of about 2, indicating the nature of the
counter-anion plays a negligible role in the Lewis acid-base interactions
between metal cations and substrates. The addition of \ch{Mg(ClO4)2} has a
greater effect on HAT reactivity, decreasing $k_H$ by a factor of 3. Magnesium
ions are a stronger Lewis acid than lithium,\cite{Fukuzumi2002} supporting the
notion of Lewis acid-base interactions between the oxygen lone-pair and the
metal cations. The decrease in $k_H$ has been partially attributed to the
reduction in hyperconjugative overlap between the oxygen lone-pair and the
neighbouring \ch{C-H} $\sigma^*$ anti-bonding orbital (See~\ref{fig:THF}), as a
consequence of the metal cation withdrawing electron density from the oxygen
lone-pair.

A 2-fold decrease in $k_H$ for the tertiary amine, triethylamine (TEA), is
observed upon the addition of \ch{LiClO4}, for which an analogous orbital
interaction explanation is also appropriate. Interestingly, the addition of 1.0
M \ch{Mg(ClO4)2} was reported to immediately form a precipitate. This
precipitate was identified as the formation of a strong TEA-\ch{Mg^{2+}} Lewis
acid-base adduct. This observation is once again consistent with the stronger
Lewis acidity of \ch{Mg^{2+}} as compared to \ch{Li^+}, and also the
significantly greater Lewis basicity of TEA vs THF.\cite{Salamone2013a,
Reichardt2010} It was also pointed out that MeCN will competitively bind with
metal cations, however it is a weaker Lewis base than both THF and TEA.
Measurements of $k_H$ for HAT between \cumo\ and TEA in the presence of 0.005 M
\ch{Mg(ClO4)2} were successful only up until [TEA] = 9.6 mM, at which point a
precipitate began to form. Nonetheless, an upper limit to the hydrogen
abstraction rate constant was estimated as $k_H <$ 1\E{6} \Ms, or at least a 200
fold decrease relative to no metal salt. Very similar results for bulkier
tertiary amines were also obtained. Thus, the presence of strong Lewis acids in
the presence of Lewis basic sites on hydrogen atom donors can deactivate
\ch{C-H} bonds.

Next, we turn to the more relevant models for the work of this thesis, the
tertiary amides $N,N$-dimethylformamide (DMF) and $N,N$-dimethylacetamide (DMA).
As with THF, normal hyperconjugative overlap between the conjugated amide
$\pi$-system and the adjacent \ch{C-H} $\sigma^*$ anti-bonding orbitals weakens
the C-H bonds. Therefore, metal binding to the amide oxygen-centre should result
in a decrease in this orbital interaction, strengthen the C-H bonds, and
decrease HAT reactivity. In their study, \citet{Salamone2015metals} measured
\cumo\ abstraction rate constants from DMF and DMA in the presence of
stoichiometric equivalents of \ch{LiClO4}, \ch{LiOTf}, \ch{NaClO4},
\ch{Mg(ClO4)2}, and \ch{Ca(ClO4)2} (in contrast to the excess used in
Reference~\citenum{Salamone2013a}). \ref{fig:k-metals-mg}a,b shows the plots of
$k_{obs}$ against [substrate] for the reactions of \cumo\ with DMF and DMA in
MeCN containing 0.2 M \ch{Mg(ClO4)2}, respectively. For both DMF and DMA, there
are three distinct regions in the plots: weak C-H bond activation for
[amide]/[\ch{Mg^{2+}}]$\leq 2$, followed by strong C-H bond deactivation for
2$<$[amide]/[\ch{Mg^{2+}}]$\leq$4, and no deactivation for
[amide]/[\ch{Mg^{2+}}]$<$4.

The addition of both \ch{LiClO4} and \ch{LiOTf} decrease to a similar extent the
rate constants for abstraction from DMF and DMA by \cumo. However, in contrast
to \ch{Mg(ClO4)2}, the lithium salts strongly deactivate \ch{C-H} bonds for 2
equivalents, followed by weak deactivation for another 2 equivalents, and no
deactivation for [amide]/[\ch{Li^{+}}]$<$4. Salamone et al. were not able to
give a clear cut explanation, but suggest that the different patterns are a
result of differences in charge density, which is greater for \ch{Mg^{2+}} than
\ch{Li^+}, as well as different coordination geometries of the two ions. A
coordination number of 4 is most common for \ch{Li^+}, while an octahedral
geometry with the coordination of 6 ligands is almost always observed for
\ch{Mg^{2+}}.\cite{Babu2013, Dudev2014} As a result, interactions of the ions
with solvent and counter-anions are suggested to be more important for
\ch{Mg^{2+}} than \ch{Li^+}.

\ch{NaClO4} and \ch{Ca(ClO4)2} influence HAT between \cumo\ and DMA to different
extents than both \ch{LiClO4} and \ch{Mg(ClO4)2}. \ref{fig:k-metals-naca}a,b
shows the plots of $k_{obs}$ against [substrate] for the reactions of \cumo\
with DMA in MeCN containing 0.2 M \ch{NaClO4} and \ch{Mg(ClO4)2}, respectively.
For \ch{NaClO4}, an almost negligible deactivation of \ch{C-H} bonds is observed
for up to 4 equivalents of DMA. This was explained on the basis of the weaker
Lewis acidity of \ch{Na^+} as compared to \ch{Li^+}. With regards to
\ch{Ca(ClO4)2}, binding to DMA fully deactivates \ch{C-H} bond abstraction up to
4 equivalents of DMA. The first region of~\ref{fig:k-metals-naca}b ([DMA] =
0--0.2 M, black circles) represents the decrease in $k_\beta$ of \cumo\ as
\ch{Ca^{2+}} preferentially binds to DMA over \cumo. Interestingly, for both DMF
and DMA, the same experiments in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent show no
inhibition of HAT reactivity by metal cations. This was rationalized on the
basis of the stronger Lewis basicity of DMSO as compared to both MeCN and the
amides, thus the metals preferentially bind solvent rather than amide substrate.

\end{figure}

Finally, \citet{Salamone2016} examined the effects of substrate structure on HAT
reaction between \cumo\ and sterically bulky tertiary alkanamides in the
presence of alkali and alkaline earth metal ions. For $N,N$-dialkylacetamides,
the steric bulk of the $N$-alkyl groups was previously
characterized.\cite{Salamone2014} Steric repulsion between \cumo\ and the
$N$-alkyl groups can decreases the HAT rate constant, as evident by the 3-fold
decrease in $k_H$ in going from DMA to $N,N$-diisobutylacetamide (DIA; 1.2\E{6}
and 3.1\E{5} \Ms, respectively). For reactions of \cumo\ with DIA addition of
0.2 M \ch{LiClO4} or \ch{Ca(ClO4)2} to results in the same trends in \ch{C-H}
bond deactivation observed for DMA. This indicates that the influence of metal
cation-substrate binding is not significantly influences by the steric bulk of
$N$-alkyl groups.  The same is true for the addition of 0.2 M \ch{Mg(ClO4)2} to
abstraction from DIA by \cumo, as shown in~\ref{fig:k-dia-mg}. Once again, a
slight decrease in reactivity is observed for the first 2 equivalents of DIA,
followed by strong C-H bond deactivation for an additional two equivalents, and
no deactivation beyond that. No additional insight was provided by Salamone et
al. as to the reason for this reactivity. The plausible explanation provided was
once again that \ch{Mg^{2+}} has a high charge density. These results show that
Lewis acid-base interactions between alkali or alkaline earth metal cations can
greatly depress hydrogen abstraction by alkyoxyl radicals.

With these results in mind, I am interested in the possibility that alkali and
alkaline earth metal cations found in biological system can protect \ch{C-H}
bonds in proteins from HAT to reactive oxygen-centred radicals. However, the
experimental results do not answer some of the key physico-chemical determinants
that may make this possible. Specifically, I have composed several important
research questions that remain unclear from the experimental results.

The first question I have is one of methodology: Can DFT-based methods can
accurately treat alkali/alkaline metal cation binding to organic substrates or
radicals? There exists limited ab initio data describing these
interactions.\cite{ Siu2001, Corral2003, Suarez2011, Baldauf2013} Therefore, I
have conducted a benchmark quality study involving \ch{Li^+}, \ch{Na^+},
\ch{Mg^{2+}}, \ch{K^+}, and \ch{Ca^{2+}}. To the best of my knowledge, this
represents the first systematic benchmark study of these metal cations with both
organic substrates and radicals.

Secondly, the nature of the binding of metal ions to substrates is still poorly
described, especially given the odd stoichiometric effects observed for
\ch{Mg(ClO4)2} with alkylamides. Specifically, I wish to address the range of
these interactions, and how much the metals effect the C-H being broken. To
address this I have utilized both \ch{Na^+} and \ch{Mg^{2+}} in my calculations.
These metal ions were chosen to capture the large differences in Lewis acidity
and ion size associated with these third-period ions, and because they are two
of the most biologically relevant metal ions.

Thirdly, I address the effect that metal ions have on the HAT barrier heights.
Experiments demonstrate that under certain conditions, the presence of metal
ions can decrease HAT reactivity. If metal ions do effectively increase C-H bond
strengths, this will be a contributing factor to the free energy barrier as per
the BEP principle\cite{Bell1936,Evans1938} (see Chapter~\ref{ch:bde}). There
will likely be additional factors such as polarization in the TS complex, or
other effects of possible charge transfer from the substrate to metal ions. To
investigate this, I have primarily studied HAT reactions involving DMA and
oxygen-centred radicals. Given there are only experimental data for \cumo, this
is the primary subject, however I was interested in structural differences of
the oxygen-centred radical, thus I have utilized \bno\ as well, which differs
significantly in that it has the ability to form strong pre-reaction complexes
with hydrogen bond accepting substrates.\cite{Salamone2012, Salamone2013} I also
investigated the effect metal cations have on the abstraction from DMA by the
more biologically relevant hydroxyl radical. I have also performed calculations
with the bulkier DIA substrate and \cumo\ to verify whether or not steric bulk
does have an influence on the ability of a metal cation to affect HAT reactions.

Finally, given that reactions of DMA with \cumo\ in the presence of metal salts
show no deactivation, I was interested in studying the reactivity of alkoxyl
radicals with strong Lewis bases. Strong Lewis basic compounds are important as
they are often used as solvents in physical organic chemical experiments.
Furthermore, strong Lewis acids are common in biological systems. Specifically,
phosphates represent an important functionality as part of the DNA backbone, as
well being important in adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the so-called ``energy
currency.'' Sulphur containing amino acids are also susceptible to oxidation
into sulfoxides and disulfoxides.\cite{Lee2009} Therefore,
understanding the HAT reactivity of strong Lewis basic compounds with
oxygen-centred radicals also contributes to the understanding of oxidative
stress in biological systems.

HAT reactions involving alkoxyl radicals and strong Lewis bases have been
previously studied,\cite{Salamone2012, vanSanten2016} and can possess
interesting and unusual chemical reactivity. For instance, we recently showed
that for the HAT reaction between \bno\ and DMSO, \bno\ acts as a hydrogen atom
donor rather the acceptor.\cite{vanSanten2016} In light of this, I examined the
effect of metal cations on the expected HAT reactivity between \cumo\ and DMSO,
as well as the radical H-atom donation reactivity between \bno\ and DMSO. I also
performed calculations to determine the effects of metal cations and if there
exists reverse reactivity for two other strong Lewis basic substrates:
hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) and tributylphosphine oxide (TBPO). The chemical
structures of all the species studies herein are shown in~\ref{fig:hat-subs}.

\section{Computational methods and details}

All quantum mechanical calculations were performed using either the Gaussian 09
software package,\cite{Frisch2009} or the TURBOMOLE software
package.\cite{turbomole} Detailed benchmark studies of metal cation-substrate
interactions were carried out, the full data and discussion of which is
presented in Appendix~\ref{ap:hat}. Calculations for the benchmark quality data
of metal binding to substrates were first optimized at the
LC-$\omega$PBE-D3(BJ)/6-31+G(2d,2p) level of theory,\cite{Vydrov2006,
Vydrov2006a, Grimme2010, Johnson2006} and later re-optimized with larger
6-311+G(3df,3pd) basis sets. Single-point energy calculations were then carried
out using the coupled cluster methodology with single, double and perturbative
triples with full core correlation, CCSD(T,Full), and various basis sets. Final
benchmark quality binding energies have been calculated using the F12$^*$
explicitly correlated method with Def2-QZVPPD primary basis sets and Def2-QZVPP
auxiliary basis sets required for the resolution-of-the-identity (RI)
approximation as implemented in TURBOMOLE. The RI approximation is used to
reduce the computational cost associated with calculating MO
integrals.\bibnote{For a detail description of the RI approximation and explicit
correlation, see Ref.~\protect\citenum{OterodelaRoza2017}, Chapter 4.} A total
of 31 different DFT-based methods with nearly complete 6-311+G(3df,3pd) and
moderate sized 6-31+G(2d,2p) basis sets were tested both by single-point energy
calculations on the benchmark structures. Geometry optimization calculations
starting from the benchmark structures were also performed for three of the best
performing DFT-based method, in order to verify their ability to capture the
minimum energy bound structures. The final DFT-based method selected from this
benchmark work is M05-2X.\cite{Zhao2006}

To test the effects of metal cations on HAT barrier heights, calculations were
first performed for the reactions not involving metal cations. Geometry
optimizations were performed at the M05-2X/6-31+G$^{**}$ level of
theory. Transition state (TS) structures were obtained by first freezing the
abstraction donor-hydrogen-acceptor bond lengths with multiple initial
orientations. The frozen bonds were then relaxed to obtain the final TS
structures, which were then used to identify the appropriate pre- and
post-reaction complexes. All structures were subjected to harmonic vibrational
frequency calculations, which were visualized using the Chemcraft
program\cite{ccraft} to verify minima (or saddle-points with a single imaginary
frequency connecting reactants to products for TS structures). Single-point
energy calculations were performed at the M05-2X/6-311+G(2d,2p) level of theory.
The effects of MeCN solvent were estimated by inclusion of the
SMD\cite{Marenich2009} continuum solvent model in single-point energy
calculations.

The inclusion of metal cations into the TS structures proved to be technically
challenging. It was my expectation that I could simply include metal cations and
necessary counter-anions into the minimum energy complex structures and
re-optimize, however this was not the case. TS structures were once again
obtained by constrained optimization with the inclusion of the metal cation and
counter-anion and freezing the abstraction donor-hydrogen-acceptor bond lengths,
providing a guess TS structure. However, in most cases the force constants
(which are necessary for a TS optimization calculation) from the guess TS
structure were not representative of the true TS structure, thus force constants
were recalculated for every step along the optimization, using the ``CalcAll''
keyword in Gaussian. This is a very computationally expensive procedure. Even
using this method, many TS structures including metal cations failed to
converge. Therefore, guess TS structures that contain a single imaginary
frequency connecting reactants to products are used in place. This technique
provides genuine TS structures, although they may not be the TS associated with
the minimum energy reaction pathway. Nonetheless, the guess TS structure can be
used provide an estimate of the reaction barrier height that are verified with
calculations that were successful. Where available, final TS structures were
used to identify the appropriate pre- and post-reaction complexes.

Natural bond order (NBO) and natural population analysis (NPA) were utilized in
order to investigate the electronic structures involved in the HAT reactions and
the effects of metal cation binding.\cite{Reed1983, Reed1985, Glendening2012}
Version 3.1 of the NBO software package,\cite{NBO3} as implemented in the
Gaussian 09 package was used in all cases.\cite{Frisch2009} NBO analysis
provides a means for estimating the physical effects of chemically intuitive
orbital interactions while NPA charges are a means for calculating the
occupancies and charges of atomic centres.\cite{Landis2014, Weinhold2016}

\section{Exploring the nature of metal cation substrate interactions}

The first step to understanding the effect non-redox active metal have on HAT
reaction barrier heights is investigating the nature of the binding interaction.
\ref{fig:pes-dma-na}a,b show the potential energy surfaces (PESs) of the binding
of sodium ion, and sodium chloride to DMA, respectively. There are three
surfaces in each plot representing the same potential energy surface in the
gas-phase (black circles), and in an SMD\cite{Marenich2009} continuum solvent
field of MeCN (grey squares) or water (white circles). For both sodium ion and
sodium chloride, the gas-phase PES demonstrates severe over-binding with respect
to a solvated system. This is indicated by a much deeper well than both solvents
and a long-range interaction that does not tail off within 6 \AA\ due to the
lack of screening. This simply underscores the importance of including solvent
effects in studying the effects of metal cations. Interestingly, for the effects
of water compared to MeCN solvent appears to be quite small. In both cases the
difference between the minimum of the water PES is about 2.5 \kcalmol, while the
differences in range of interaction is negligible. Furthermore, the minimum of
the PES well in all cases falls at about the same distance (2.1--2.2 \AA) in the
gas-phase and in both solvents. The small differences in binding interactions
indicate that the effects as measured in MeCN should also apply to the more
biologically relevant aqueous system.

For both the ion and the salt of sodium in water and MeCN, the binding
interaction only approaches zero slowly. Even at 6 \AA, the predicted binding
energy of DMA in water with \ch{Na^+} and \ch{NaCl} are 1.1 and 0.7 \kcalmol,
respectively. This is an indication that M05-2X-SMD does not properly capture
long-range interactions of DMA with sodium. This may either be a result of an
incorrect treatment of multireference wavefunction character, or a result of SMD
not fully capturing the screening effect of solvent. Nonetheless, the
interaction approaches zero before 5 \AA, which corresponds well with the size
of the first solvation shell of the sodium ion.\cite{Degreve1996} This result is
consistent with literature that studies the Hofmeister series, where it has been
shown that biologically relevant cations are only able to influence their
immediate solvation shell.\cite{Omta2003, Funkner2011} Furthermore,
\citet{Heyda2009} utilized molecular dynamics simulations of $N$-methylacetamide
in aqueous solutions of NaCl, NaBr, KCl, and KBr to obtained radial distribution
functions (RDFs). The RDFS are in agreement with the calculated PESs in that the
most probable distance to find \ch{Na^+} from the amidic oxygen-centre is at
about 2--2.5 \AA\ separation. Heyda et al. also showed that \ch{Na^+} binds more
strongly with the amide than \ch{K^+}, and that the nature of the halide
counteranion does not contribute significantly to the overall interaction. This
is consistent with the results of Salamone et al., which showed that the nature
of the counteranion plays a negligible role to the effect on rate
constants.\cite{Salamone2013a} Note that is is likely important to include a
counteranion in the calculations. From these results it is possible to draw an
important conclusion: The use of \ch{Cl^-} in the calculations should reasonably
reflect the trends observed by Salamone et al.  with \ch{ClO4^-} and \ch{OTf^-}.

\end{figure}

\ref{fig:pes-dma-mg}a,b show the PESs of the binding of magnesium ion, and
magnesium dichloride to DMA, respectively. As is the case for \ch{Na^+}, the
gas-phase PES of \ch{Mg^{2+}} is extremely over-bound, so much so in fact, that
the interaction does not approach zero. At an O--Mg distance of 12 \AA, there is
calculated binding interaction of -48.5 \kcalmol, which is actually greater than
at 6 \AA\ by about 5 \kcalmol. The unphysical behaviour is a prime example of a
failing of DFT-based methods. Here, the DFT calculations are unable to localize
the charge properly due to delocalization error,\cite{Cohen2008} even with the
use of a high-percentage HF hybrid density functional. The localization of
charges was recently described by \citet{Cheng2016} as a widespread failing of
every DFT-based method they tested.

The reason this is a problem with \ch{Mg^{2+}} and not \ch{Na^+} has to do with
the ionization potentials (IP) of the metals with respect to that of DMA. The
experimental IP\cite{Slifkin1967, Baldwin1977, CRC2016} of DMA is 8.8--9.2 eV,
the first IP of Na is 5.1 eV, and the second IP of Mg is 15.0 eV (calculated
with M05-2X/6-311+G(2d,2p) = 8.9, 5.0, and 14.9 eV, respectively). In a real
system, magnesium ions exist invariably in the +2 oxidation state, however, due
to nature of the IPs, DFT-based methods prefer to delocalize the charge,
resulting in non-physical binding between DMA and \ch{Mg^2+}, but not for
\ch{Na+}. A possible resolution to this is to use a constrained DFT method that
enables one to specify atomic occupancies,\cite{Melander2016} however, this
technique is not currently available in most common quantum chemical packages.

\end{figure}

The inclusion of MeCN and water solvent appear at first glance to alleviate this
problem. Note however that both PESs cross over zero binding at about 3
\kcalmol, indicating there is still delocalization error. Additionally, for
magnesium chloride in the gas-phase, there also appears to be delocalization
error occurring, as evident by the PES crossing zero just below 4 \kcalmol. On
the other hand, the inclusion of either water or MeCN solvent with \ch{MgCl2}
give reasonable PESs with a binding interaction of about 25 \kcalmol\ for both
water and MeCN, and a tailing off at about 3 \AA, or slightly larger than the
size of the first hydration shell of \ch{Mg^2+} (ca. 2
\AA).\cite{Chatterjee2013} Therefore, studying the effects of magnesium on HAT
reaction barrier may be possible using \ch{MgCl2}, however given the
difficulties with Mg in general, I elected to focus only on \ch{NaCl} for future
considerations.

Next, I performed calculations to determine if the interaction of metal cations
systematically increase the bond strengths of \ch{C-H} bonds by decreasing
hyperconjugative overlap between neighbouring $\pi$-systems and \ch{C-H}
$\sigma^*$ anti-bonding orbitals. The BDEs for several substrates in the
presence of \ch{Na^+} and \ch{NaCl} are listed in~\ref{tab:bde-metal}. The
ROCBS-QB3 BDEs for each of the substrates is included to demonstrate that the
relative order of BDEs for substrates with multiple \ch{C-H} bonds is
reasonable. The BDE for an arbitrary metal substrate complex
(\ch{M\bond{dotted}X-H}) can be calculated as:

\begin{equation}
BDE = E(\ch{M\bond{dotted}X^.}) + E(\ch{H^.}) - E(\ch{M\bond{dotted}X-H})
\end{equation}

For DMA, the $N$-methyl groups cis and trans relative to the carbonyl are the
weakest and therefore most thermodynamically favourable for abstraction.
\citet{Salamone2013} showed that both \bno\ and \cumo\ prefer to abstract from
the $N$-methyl groups of DMA, rather than the acetyl group. The inclusion of
\ch{Na^+} increases the cis BDE by 1.0 \kcalmol\ and the trans BDE by 1.2
\kcalmol, while \ch{NaCl} increases the cis BDE by 1.8 \kcalmol\ and the trans
BDE by 1.0 \kcalmol. Here we shall use NBO analysis that gives a qualitative
description based on perturbation theory as to the energy contribution of
specific NBO orbitals.\cite{Weinhold2016} From the NBO analysis, the average
hyperconjugative weakening effect upon complexation for the $N$-methyl \ch{C-H}
bonds is about 5.6 and 5.9 \kcalmol\ for the cis and trans positions,
respectively. The inclusion of \ch{Na^+} decreases the bond weakening effect to
the 3.7 and 4.1 \kcalmol, while \ch{NaCl} decreases the bond weakening effect to
5.4 and 5.5 \kcalmol\ for the cis and trans positions, respectively. Therefore,
the decrease in bond strengthening effect in going from \ch{Na^+} to \ch{NaCl}
does not fully reflect the change in hyperconjugative bond weakening. The
differences can be ascribed to effects from charge transfer that differentially
stabilize the parent and radical complexes of DMA.\@ Additionally the calculated
cis-DMA BDE increases with \ch{NaCl}, which is due to a hydrogen-bond like
interaction between the \ch{Cl^-} and the acetyl methyl group of the cis-methyl
radical of DMA that destabilizes the radical by donating electron density into
an already acidic \ch{C-H} bond. \ref{fig:dma-na-cl}a-d show the structures of
DMA-NaCl and the three radicals, and it can be seen in~\ref{fig:dma-na-cl}c that
the cis radical complex is the only structure with an interaction between DMA
and \ch{Cl^-}.  One possible reason for this difference is a repulsive
interaction between the cis radical and the \ch{Cl^-}.

\end{figure}

Interestingly, the predicted BDE for the acetyl radical of DMA decreases with
both \ch{Na^+} and \ch{NaCl}. This can be attributed to the change in electronic
structure associated with complexation. Consider the two possible resonance
forms of DMA shown in ~\ref{fig:dma-res}. \cite{Hrabal1997} utilized natural
resonance theory to estimate that the right-hand resonance structure in the
closely related formamide contributes about 30\% to the overall resonance
hybrid. On the other hand, straight forward NBO analysis predicts a bond order
in DMA of 1.5 between the C and O and the C and N. Nonetheless, the complexation
of DMA to \ch{Na^+} slightly increases the contribution of the zwitterionic
form, resulting in a decrease in electron density at the carbonyl carbon. This
is evidenced by the increase in NPA charge at the carbonyl from +0.72 in DMA to
+0.74 in the DMA-\ch{Na^+} complex.  The partially positively-charged carbon
centre inductively withdraws electron density, stabilizing the acetyl radical,
increasing the $\pi$ bonding character between the two carbon centres, and
decreasing the effective BDE. This is also evidence by the decrease in the
carbonyl-acetyl C-C bond lengths in the acetyl radical, which decrease from
1.457 \AA to 1.443 \AA upon complexation of \ch{Na^+}. Complexation of
\ch{NaCl} results in a bond length of 1.451 \AA, which is consistent with the
BDE results.  On the other hand, the amidic nitrogen becomes net more positive,
but still has an NPA charge that is negative. As a results, there is no
inductive stabilization effect for the $N$-methyl radicals.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/DMA-resonance.eps}
  \caption{The resonance forms of DMA.}
  \label{fig:dma-res}
\end{figure}

For MeCN and DMSO the complexation of either \ch{Na^+} or \ch{NaCl} results in a
decrease in \ch{C-H} BDE.\@ In MeCN, the hyperconjugative overlap between the
\ch{C+N} $\pi$-system and the \ch{C-H} $\sigma^*$ anti-bonding orbital decreases
as a result of the interaction between \ch{Na^+} and the nitrogen centre. DMSO
has a non-Lewis electronic structure, making it difficult to analyze orbital
interactions of valence-bond orbitals. Nonetheless, there is normally a nominal
hyperconjugative overlap between the sulphur centre and the \ch{C-H} $\sigma^*$
anti-bonding orbitals, which was confirmed by NBO analysis. This overlap
decreases as a result of the interaction of \ch{Na^+} with the oxygen-centre of
DMSO.

Upon complexation of \ch{Na+} of \ch{NaCl}, the BDEs of the more sterically
bulky amide substrate DIA follow the same trend that is observed as for DMA: The
acetyl \ch{C-H} BDE decreases due to inductive stabilization, while the \ch{C-H}
bonds $\alpha$ to the amidic nitrogen centre increase as a result of decreased
hyperconjugative overlap. Alkoxyl radicals are not expected to abstract from
\ch{C-H} bonds $\beta$ to the nitrogen centre in DIA or other longer chain
$N$-alkyl amides, as the incipient radical is not stabilized by amidic
$\pi$-system. However, due to steric repulsion, the $\alpha$-radicals of DIA
cannot lie directly plane of allowing conjugation with the $\pi$-system. As such
the $\alpha$-\ch{C-H} BDEs of DIA are greater than those of DMA by 2-3 \kcalmol,
and are closer to the $\beta$-\ch{C-H} BDEs than perhaps expected. The effects
of sodium binding to the amidic oxygen are almost nil for the $\beta$-trans C-H
bond of DIA, however there is a significant decrease in the $\beta$-cis \ch{C-H}
BDE. \ref{fig:dia-na-cl}a,b shows the structures of the DIA-NaCl complex and the
$\beta$-cis radical complex, where it can seen that the metal cation interacts
with both the oxygen-centre and the carbon-centred radical. This interaction
stabilizes the radical complex and thus decreases the effective BDE, however
this interaction is likely not possible in the TS structure and is not expected
to contribute to the effective BDE in a HAT reaction.

\end{figure}

All of these results together confirm that specific metal-substrate interactions
can increase the effective BDEs of abstractable \ch{C-H} bonds by decreasing
hyperconjugative overlap. However, this is complicated by the possibility for
secondary interactions between the metal or counter-anion. Furthermore,
additional factors such as induction can alter the effects. It appears that for
\ch{C-H} bonds $\alpha$ to electron-rich species that hyperconjugatively
overlap with the $\sigma^*$ anti-bonding orbital, the complexation of non-redox
active metals increases the \ch{C-H} bond strength. However, if the \ch{C-H}
bond is adjacent to an electron-poor centre, such as the carbon of a carbonyl,
metal complexation actually decreases the bond strength slightly by stabilizing
the carbon-centred radical.  In the context of HAT reaction barrier heights,
increasing the effective \ch{C-H} bond strength should decrease the
reaction-rate slightly by destabilizing the TS complex. However, there are other
important factors to consider such as how the metal effects the dipole moment in
the TS complex.  Furthermore, it is important to note that experiments showed
that \ch{NaClO4} did not significantly effect the HAT rate constants for
reactions between \cumo\ and organic substrates. Therefore, the effects observed
herein likely are an exaggeration of what is truly occurring in situ.
Nonetheless, these theoretical calculations may be useful in developing an
understanding of the subtle nature of the effects of non-redox active metal
cations on HAT reactions in general.

With regards to the implications these results have on protein systems, since
abstraction occurs predominantly from an $\alpha$-\ch{C-H} bonds, it is likely
that the nature of the amino acid, and the three dimensional structure of the
protein will have significant importance. As the geometry of the peptide
backbone becomes more strained by steric interactions, the \ch{C-H} bond will
become more difficult to abstract, as evident by the higher \ch{C-H} BDEs in DIA
as compared to DMA. Additionally, if alkali or alkaline earth-metals are able to
bind to a given carbonyl site on the surface of a protein, they may exert a
chemo-protective effect by increasing the BDE of an adjacent \ch{C-H}
bond.

\section{HAT reactions involving non-redox active metals}

\subsection{DMA}

Hydrogen abstraction reactions involving the oxygen-centred radicals \bno\ and
\cumo\ and DMA in MeCN have been previously investigated experimentally and
theoretically.\cite{Salamone2013} The HAT reaction between DMA and \bno\ was
determined to occur predominantly through a direct HAT mechanism from the
$N$-methyl group cis relative to the carbonyl, and is kinetically limited by the
formation of a strong pre-reaction complex between the relatively acid
$\alpha$-C-H of \bno\ and the amidic oxygen centre. On the other hand, \cumo\
cannot form a strong hydrogen-bonding interaction, and thus can form a
non-specific dispersion-bound pre-reaction complexes. Abstraction by \cumo\
still takes place from one of the $N$-methyl groups, but the rate constant is 2
orders of magnitude less than for \bno. Recall that the inclusion of metal salts
in reactions of DMA with \cumo\ were previously
investigated.\cite{Salamone2015metals} On the basis of the exaggerated effects
observed in the changes in BDEs and the technical difficulties associated with
these studies, the goal of this work is not to reproduce experimental results,
but rather, develop insights into the possible changes that can occur as a
result of metal salt addition to HAT reactions.

Herein, I have calculated the reaction barrier heights for all three
abstractable positions of DMA for HAT reactions involving \cumo\ and \bno, both
with and without \ch{NaCl}. These data are summarized in~\ref{tab:DMA-dG}.
Perhaps alarmingly, the free energy barriers calculated at the
M05-2X-SMD(MeCN)/6-311+G(2d,2p)//M05-2X/6-31+G$^{**}$ are systematically higher
than those previously calculated by about 8.5 \kcalmol.\cite{Salamone2013} The
previously calculated results were in reasonable agreement with experimental
results. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, given that M05-2X has
previously been used successfully to calculate accurate HAT rate
constants.\cite{Galano2013} Furthermore, the optimized minimum energy structures
from both methods do not differ significantly, with the exception of slightly
shorter abstracting \ch{C-H} partial bonds and slightly elongated \ch{O-H}
partial in the TS structures excluding \ch{NaCl} (ca. 0.03 to 0.05 \AA).
However, the relative ranking and differences in energies for the reaction
barrier heights for the different \ch{C-H} bonds are consistent with previous
results. Therefore, although these results cannot be used to predict rate
constants, they are useful for studying the change in barrier height due to the
addition of NaCl.

              &  acetyl             &  22.0(4.7)           &    1.2(-3.1)
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Focussing first on the barrier heights for HAT between DMA and \cumo, the
results of complexation with \ch{NaCl} is variable. For each of the acetyl, cis,
and trans \ch{C-H} bond positions of DMA, there are three distinct effects upon
complexation of \ch{NaCl}. For the trans position, both the free energy and
enthalpic barriers increase, for the cis position the free energy barrier
increases and the enthalpic barrier decreases, and for the acetyl position both
the free energy and enthalpic barriers decrease. The reasons for this can be
understood by examining the TS structures, which are shown
in~\ref{fig:dma-cumo-ts}a-f.

\end{figure}

First, note for all the TS structures in \ref{fig:dma-cumo-ts}, the complexation
of \ch{NaCl} results in a shortening of the \ch{O-H} bond that is being formed
as a result of the HAT reaction. This indicates that the TS structure shifts
towards the product side along the reaction coordinate as a results of
interactions with \ch{NaCl}. By Hammond's postulate,\cite{Hammond1955} this
indicates a more endothermic reaction, giving evidence for increased reaction
barrier heights.

For the TS structure representing abstraction from the trans position (relative
to the carbonyl) \ch{C-H} bond of DMA by \cumo\ (\ref{fig:dma-cumo-ts}a), there
is a calculated 0.3 \kcalmol\ increase in $\Delta H^\ddagger$, which is somewhat
less than the predicted increase in BDE of 1.0 \kcalmol. This result is
consistent with the BEP principle, as the change is $\Delta H^\ddagger$ is
necessarily less than or equal to the change in $\Delta H$ due to the constant
$\alpha$ in Equation~\ref{eq:bep}. This difference can possible be ascribed to
the effect of charge transfer: NPA indicates a 0.04 $e^-$ transfer from DMA to
\ch{NaCl}. As a result, there is less electron density available for
hyperconjugative orbital overlap, and thus there is a lesser effect upon $\Delta
H^\ddagger$.  Furthermore, TSs for HAT between \ch{C-H} bond and oxygen-centred
radicals are characterized by a degree of charge separation.\cite{Roberts1999}
NPA indicates that in the trans position TS structure excluding \ch{NaCl} the
charge transfer from DMA to \cumo\ is 0.24 $e^-$, but the charge transfer
increases with the inclusion of \ch{NaCl} to 0.26 $e^-$. This increased charge
separation results in a lower enthalpic barrier than expected solely on the
basis of the increase in \ch{C-H} BDE. While orbital analysis does not indicate
any PCET type orbital interactions, charge separation between DMA and \cumo\ in
the TS structure may be considered as a partial ionization of the hydrogen atom.
Therefore, by increasing charge separation in the TS structure, it becomes
easier to abstract the hydrogen atom as there is an increase in the
proton-transfer like character of the hydrogen atom. The increase in $\Delta
G^\ddagger$ is 3.0 \kcalmol, therefore the complexation of metal cations
increases the entropic penalty in forming the TS structure.

In the abstraction of the cis position \ch{C-H} bond of DMA by \cumo, there is a
calculated 2.6 \kcalmol\ decrease in $\Delta H^\ddagger$ and an increase of 0.9
\kcalmol\ in $\Delta G^\ddagger$. The decrease in enthalpic barrier is
inconsistent with the predicted increase in BDE of 1.8 \kcalmol\ upon
complexation with \ch{NaCl}. The TS structure in~\ref{fig:dma-cumo-ts}c shows a
possible long range interaction between \ch{Na} and the aromatic ring of \cumo\
that draws electron density and increases the reactivity. Additionally, NPA
predicts a 0.07 $e^-$ charge transfer between DMA and \ch{Na}. The combination
of these two factors stabilizes the TS and decreases $\Delta H^\ddagger$. The
entropic penalty associated with complexation of \ch{NaCl} results in an
increase in free energy barrier.

Abstraction by \cumo\ from the acetyl \ch{C-H} bond of DMA was previously
described as being a minor reaction pathway.\cite{Salamone2013} In light of the
reduction in BDE at the acetyl position of amides, it may be reasonable to
expect the reaction barrier to decrease. This indeed appears to be the net
effect of complexation of \ch{NaCl} to DMA, as $\Delta H^\ddagger$ decreases by
3.1 \kcalmol\ and $\Delta G^\ddagger$ decreases by 0.6 \kcalmol.
\ref{fig:dma-cumo-ts}f shows that in the TS structure, \ch{Na} interacts with
the aromatic system of \cumo, which also stabilizes the TS and decreases the
barrier, but not enough to make it the lowest barrier.

For HAT between DMA and \bno, the interaction between \ch{NaCl} and \bno, are
stronger owing to the shorter distance between \ch{Na} and the centre of the
aromatic ring, as shown in~\ref{fig:dma-bno-ts}a-f. Note that, as in reactions
with \cumo, the \ch{O-H} partial bond in the TS structures are shorter upon
complexation with \ch{NaCl}, indicating greater product-like character in the TS
complex. This shorter distance is likely possible due to the easier rotation of
DMA relative to \bno, as compared to \cumo. As a result, the enthalpic barriers
for the abstraction from DMA by \bno\ decrease upon complexation of \ch{NaCl} to
both the acetyl and trans position \ch{C-H} bonds. For the cis position \ch{C-H}
bond of DMA however, the enthalpic barrier increases.

This can be explained on the basis of the presence of an interaction between
\ch{Cl} and the $\alpha$-\ch{C-H} bond of \bno. While \ch{Na} withdraws electron
density from the aromatic system of \bno, \ch{Cl} is able to donate electron
density back to \bno, counteracting the effect of the interaction of \ch{Na}.
Charge analysis confirms this, such that the NPA charge on Cl in the cis
position abstraction TS complex is -0.88 $e^-$, as compared to -0.91 $e^-$ in
abstraction from the trans position. As a result, the enthalpic barrier
increases as predicted on the basis of the increase of the cis position \ch{C-H}
BDE of DMA.

For both \cumo\ and \bno, the presence of possible secondary interactions
between \ch{NaCl} and the radicals obfuscates the results. Therefore, in order
to determine if non-redox active metal cations may act as chemo-protective
agents in biological systems, I have performed calculated involving the more
biologically relevant \ch{HO^.} radical. Although there is no literature value
for $k_H$ of the HAT reaction between DMA and \ch{HO^.}, I have used the
Snelgrove-Ingold equation\cite{Snelgrove2001} to estimate the rate constant as
1.5\E{10} \Ms, which is two and five orders of magnitude greater than \bno\ and
\cumo, respectively. Unfortunately, I was unsuccessful in performing full
optimization calculations in the presence of the metal salt. Therefore, I have
listed these preliminary results and the analysis thereof in~\ref{ap:hat}.


\subsection{DIA}

Next, to study the effect steric bulk has on the HAT reactions between amides
and oxygen-centred radical, I have performed a study of HAT between DIA and
\cumo. The HAT reaction between DIA and \cumo\ was previously studied by
\citet{Salamone2014}, however only the $\alpha$-N-alkyl positions were studied
theoretically. Since the BDEs for $\alpha$- and $\beta$-N-alkyl \ch{C-H}
positions are relatively close in energy, I calculated the reaction barriers
for these positions as well. The calculated free energy (enthalpic) barriers
excluding and including \ch{NaCl} are listed in ~\ref{tab:dia-cumo}.
Interestingly the predicted reaction barriers for abstraction of the
$\beta$-positions of DIA are lower than the $\alpha$-positions. By applying the
Boltzmann distribution about 69\% of abstractions by \cumo\ from DIA will take
place from either the cis- or trans-$\beta$ positions of DIA. Therefore,
abstraction from bulky amides by bulky oxygen-centred radicals are likely
controlled by steric considerations. Note also that many of the TS
optimizations were not successful with the inclusion of \ch{NaCl} and in which
case ``guess'' TS structures have been used to estimate the barrier heights.
The TS structures for the HAT reaction between DIA and \cumo\ including
\ch{NaCl} are shown in~\ref{fig:dia-cumo-ts}.

\end{figure}

As was observed in the barrier height calculations involving \ch{NaCl} with DMA
with \bno\ and \cumo, the results vary depending on the presence or absence of
secondary interactions of \ch{Na} with \cumo. For the $\beta$-cis and acetyl
position of DIA (\ref{fig:dia-cumo-ts}d-e), $\Delta H^\ddagger$ decreases by 2.3
and 0.2 \kcalmol, respectively, as a result of relatively long range
interactions of \ch{Na} with the aromatic system of \cumo. For abstraction from
the $\alpha$-cis position of DIA (\ref{fig:dia-cumo-ts}b), \ch{Na} is able to
interact with both the amidic oxygen lone pair, and a lone pair on the oxygen of
\cumo, resulting in a significant decrease in $\Delta H^\ddagger$ by 7.8
\kcalmol.

For the $\alpha$-trans position there is no interaction between \ch{Na} and
\cumo, however the complexation of \ch{NaCl} to DIA results in a 2.5 \kcalmol\
decrease in $\Delta G^\ddagger$. Comparing the TS structures including and
excluding NaCl, there is very little difference. Therefore, it is likely that
the ``guess'' TS structure including NaCl does not appropriately represent the
``true'' TS structure for this particular abstraction site. Note that this may
also be the case in other systems.

Abstraction by \cumo\ from the $\beta$-trans position of DIA does not allow for
an interaction between both the amidic oxygen and \cumo. However, there should
be no effect from decreasing hyperconjugation. Consequently, $\Delta H^\ddagger$
increases by 1.4 \kcalmol\ as a result of the effect of 0.04 $e^-$ charge
transfer from DIA to \ch{Na} in the TS structure.


\subsection{Strong hydrogen bond accepting substates}

In the investigation of the effects of metal cations on HAT reactions between
DMA and \cumo\ Salamone et al. demonstrated that in DMSO solvent, HAT reactivity
is not significantly affected by the addition of metal
salts.\cite{Salamone2015metals} This can be explained on the basis of the
stronger Lewis basicity of DMSO as as compared to DMA, resulting in the
competitive binding of \ch{M^n+} to DMSO over DMA. The rate constant for HAT
between DMSO and \cumo\ in DMSO solvent is 1.8 \E{4} \Ms\ while that for DMSO
and \cumo\ is 1.2 \E{6} \Ms\ in MeCN solvent at 298 K, therefore only small
changes in $k_{obs}$ are expected for HAT between \cumo\ and DMA in DMSO solvent
with metal salts. I am interested in how metal salts affect the HAT reactivity
of DMSO and other related strong hydrogen bond accepting substrates. We
previously showed that DMSO and \bno\ react via a radical H-atom donation
reaction, where \bno\ acts counterintuatively as the hydrogen atom donor rather
than acceptor. The net reaction yields benzaldehyde, dimethyl sulfide, and
\ch{HO^.} as the DMSO-H radical decomposes in a concerted manner following the
radical H-atom donation TS.

An important driving force in this reaction is the formation of benzaldehyde by
cleavage of an acidic $\alpha$-\ch{C-H} bond. This is not possible in \cumo\,
therefore \cumo\ does not react through radical H-atom donation. I have
performed computational studies to determined if metal cations could affect this
reactivity and if the related (HMPA and TBPO) substrates displayed similar
reactivity.

Focussing first of the reactions of DMSO with \cumo\ and \bno\ in the presence
of \ch{NaCl}. The reactions studied are shown in~\ref{fig:dmso-rxn} and the
calculated free energy (enthalpic) barriers are listed in~\ref{tab:dmso-dG}.
Also, the TS structures for the reactions in~\ref{fig:dmso-rxn} are shown
in~\ref{fig:dmso-ts}a-f. Firstly, for HAT between DMSO and \cumo\ in the
presence of \ch{NaCl} (Reaction 1,~\ref{fig:dmso-ts}b), the free energy barrier
increases by 1.5 \kcalmol\, however the enthalpic barrier decreases by 3.7
\kcalmol. This can be explained in a similar manner to the reactions of DMA:
\ch{Na^+} interacts both with the oxygen of DMSO and the aromatic system of
\cumo, resulting in a stabilization of the TS and a decrease in enthalpic
barrier in spite of a predicted increase in \ch{C-H} BDE. This binding however
results in a tighter TS structure, thus the entropic cost increases and so does
the $\Delta G^\ddagger$.

Next, the reaction of DMSO with \bno\ was previously
characterized\cite{Salamone2012} as occurring through the rate determining
formation of a strong pre-reaction complex, however, we more recently showed the
reaction likely takes place through a reaction in which \bno\ acts as a hydrogen
atom donor, rather than acceptor.\cite{vanSanten2016} For this radical H-atom
donation reaction between DMSO and \bno\ in the presence of \ch{NaCl} (Reaction
2,~\ref{fig:dmso-ts}d), the free energy barrier increases as a result of
\ch{NaCl} complexation. This is appears to be an entropic effect as a result of
binding, as $\Delta H^\ddagger$ decreases by 1.2 \kcalmol\ due to the
interaction of \ch{Na} with DMSO and the aromatic ring of \bno. In this TS
structure excluding \ch{NaCl} there is some charge separation, however, DMSO
(the acceptor) has a partial positive charge and \bno\ (the donor) has a partial
negative charge. This is contrary to typical HAT reactions between
oxygen-centred radicals and \ch{C-H} bonds where in the TS structure, the donor
typically has a partial positive charge and the acceptor has a partial positive
charge. Therefore, the significant reduction in charge separation from 0.25
$e^-$ to 0.11 $e^-$ appears to play a lesser role. This may be due to the
unusual electronic structure of sulfoxide compounds, which cannot easily be
defined using simple Lewis structures. The radical H-atom donation reaction is
likely driven by the concerted cleavage of the \ch{S=O} bond of DMSO-H.

While the conventional HAT reaction between DMSO and \bno\ is unlikely to occur
as the barrier is ca. 12 \kcalmol higher than the radical H-atom donation
reaction, it is still interesting to consider the effect that \ch{NaCl} has on
the reaction barrier height. \ref{fig:dmso-ts}f shows that in the TS structure
for the conventional HAT reaction between DMSO and \bno\ in the presence of
\ch{NaCl}, there is a relatively close interaction with both the oxygen of DMSO
and the aromatic ring of \bno. As a result, the free energy (enthalpic) barrier
decreases by 0.6(5.2) \kcalmol. NPA estimates a relatively large (as compared to
the DMA HAT reactions) 0.10 $e^-$ charge transfer from DMSO to \ch{Na},
resulting in a decrease in charge separation in the TS structure from 0.27 $e^-$
to 0.21 $e^-$.

Turning now to the reactions of \bno\ with the substrates HMPA and TBPO, which
are closely related phosphine oxide compounds that are commonly used as organic
solvents. These two substrates are also closely related to DMSO in that they are
strong hydrogen bond accepting substrates, and therefore may undergo a radical
H-atom donation reaction in which \bno\ donates an acidic $\alpha$-\ch{C-H}
hydrogen atom, rather than accepting in the conventional manner. The reaction
coordinate diagrams from HMPA with \bno\ and TBPO with \bno\ are shown
in~\ref{fig:hmpa-tbpo-bno}a and b, respectively. In the possible radical H-atom
donation reactions for both substrates the free energy barrier is lower than the
conventional HAT barrier by 6 \kcalmol\ for HMPA and 10 \kcalmol\ for TBPO.
However, in both cases the process is energetically uphill, and so is unlikely
to occur. For both the radical products HMPA-H and TBPO-H, the cleavage of the
\ch{P=O} bond results in an additional 20 \kcalmol energy cost owing to the
significantly greater strength of \ch{P=O} bonds as compared to \ch{S=O} bonds
(The BDEs are 86 \kcalmol\ in DMSO vs. 147 \kcalmol\ in
HMPA).\bibnote{Calculated using the ROCBS-QB3 method.} Therefore, radical H-atom
donation reactivity is likely partially driven by the cleavage of the \ch{S=O}
bond in DMSO.

  \label{fig:hmpa-tbpo-bno}
\end{figure}


As HMPA and TBPO do not react via radical H-atom donation with \bno, I did not
seek the determine the effects of \ch{NaCl} on these reaction barriers. Note
also, that unlike DMSO, NBO analysis reveals no strong hyperconjugative overlap
between the \ch{P=O} orbitals and the abstractable \ch{C-H} bonds of TBPO or
HMPA. From an orbital energetic standpoint, this is expected, given the overall
higher overall energy of \ch{P=O} orbitals, as compared to \ch{S=O} orbitals.
Therefore, the effects of metal complexation to the phosphine oxygen (where
\ch{Na} will bind) should not significantly affect the \ch{C-H} bond strengths
or enthalpic barrier heights. The HAT reaction barrier heights of \ch{NaCl} with
with HMPA and TBPO for the HAT reaction with \cumo\ are listed
in~\ref{tab:hmpa-tbpo}. The TS structures for direct HAT reactions between HMPA
or TBPO with \cumo\ and \bno\ including \ch{NaCl} are shown

inclusion of \ch{NaCl}. All barrier heights are relative to separated reactants
(or complexed HMPA/TBPO-NaCl) and were calculated at the
M05-2X-SMD(MeCN)/6-311+G(2d,2p)//M05-2X/6-31+G$^{**}$ level of theory.

For HMPA with \cumo\ and \bno\ in the presence of \ch{NaCl}, the HAT reaction
barrier decreases in both cases. For the reaction with \cumo\
(\ref{fig:hmpa-tbpo-ts}a), this can be explained on the basis of the interaction
between \ch{Na} with both the phosphine oxygen and the aromatic system of
\cumo. However for the reaction with \bno\ (\ref{fig:hmpa-tbpo-ts}b), there is
not such interaction with the aromatic system of \bno. In this case, the
decrease in reaction barrier can be ascribed to the lack of rotation of the
\ch{CH2O^.} moiety of \bno. Previously computational
investigations\cite{Salamone2011a,Salamone2012} demonstrate a typical rotation
of the \ch{CH2O^.} moiety of \bno\ of about 30 to 45$^\circ$, while the TS in
\ref{fig:hmpa-tbpo-ts}b has an angle of about 5$^\circ$. In the HAT reaction
between HMPA and \bno\ excluding \ch{NaCl}, there is a rotation of this moiety
by ca. 30$^\circ$. The complexation of \ch{NaCl} breaks the hydrogen bond
between the $\alpha$-\ch{C-H} bond of \bno\ with the oxygen of HMPA, and forms a
now interaction between \ch{Cl^-} and the $\alpha$-\ch{C-H} bond of \bno. This
new interaction stabilizes the TS and allows the oxygen-centre of \bno\ to
remain in the plain of the aromatic system.

Finally, for the reactions of TBPO with \cumo\ and \bno\ there are long range
interactions of \ch{Na} with the aromatic systems resulting in a decrease in
$\Delta H^\ddagger$. The free energy barrier for \cumo\ is not significantly
affected, while it increases by about 1.5 \kcalmol\ for \bno. This is likely due
to the longer range interaction of \ch{Na} with \cumo\ as compared to \bno\
(4.0 \AA\ vs. 3.6 \AA, respectively).

\section{Summary}

The effects of non-redox active metal cations upon the barrier heights of HAT
reactions between small protein models and Lewis basic organic substrates with
oxygen-centred radicals were investigated herein. First, benchmark studies were
performed to determine the best available DFT-based method for studying the
interactions between alkali and alkaline earth metals with organic substrates
and radicals. Calculations of the gas-phase binding energies reveal that most
DFT-based methods can reasonably predict the binding interactions.
