earth metals to organic substrates and oxygen-centred radicals}
\sectionmark{Benchmarking DFT based methods}
\label{sec:benchmark}

In order to be confident of the results of quantum mechanical mechanistic
studies, the method of choice must be calibrated. While DFT-based methods have
been widely applied to these studied, few studies have previously investigated
alkali and alkaline earth-metal cation binding to organic
substrates.\cite{Corral2003, Suarez2011, Siu2001, Baldauf2013} Most importantly,
benchmark quality data for a wide variety of metals binding to biologically
relevant substrates and oxygen-centred radicals does not exist to calibrate
DFT-based methods. Therefore, I performed a benchmark study which incorporated
all the biologically relevant alkali and alkaline earth-metal cations, models
for dipeptides including amino acid side-chains, oxygen-centred radicals, and
solvents which are utilized in the experimental mechanistic studies involved in
probing these systems. Unfortunately, due to computational restrictions
(\emph{vide infra}), benchmark quality calculations on the originally proposed
benchmark set were not possible. Full details of the originally proposed
benchmark set are shown in~\ref{fig:ap-set1}.

\begin{scheme}[!htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/set1.eps}
    \caption[Initial proposed benchmark set of substrates/radicals and metal
    cations.]{Initial proposed benchmark set of substrates/radicals and metal
    cations. Note this set consists of all combinations of substrates and metal
    cation, thus there are 75 complexes in the set. Conformational analysis
    using the Hyperchem package\cite{Hyperchem16} to identify the lowest energy
    conformers of all the substrates was completed using the AM1 semi-empirical
    approach. Geometry optimizations were then performed without metal cations
    at the LC-$\omega$PBE-D3(BJ)/6-31+G(2d,2p) level of theory. Several binding
    sites were investigated and optimized at the same level of theory.
    Benchmark quality structures have been optimized at the
    LC-$\omega$PBE-D3(BJ)/6-311+G(3df,3pd) level of theory. I am awaiting
    computational resources to performed CCSD(T)-F12$^*$/Def2-QZVPPD
    calculations.} \label{fig:ap-set1}
\end{scheme}

Benchmark quality binding energies are generally calculated using the ``gold
standard'' approach, CCSD(T)/CBS, where correlation consistent basis
sets\cite{Marshall2011, Rezac2013} (cc-pV\emph{X}Z, \emph{X}=T,Q,5) developed by
Dunning and\cite{Vydrov2006, Vydrov2006a} co-workers are used for complete basis
set extrapolation. For the alkali and alkaline earth-metals, \citet{Iron2003}
demonstrated that additional $d$-type basis functions are necessary to obtain
reasonable results. It is also necessary to include core-correlation of at least
the first core shell in alkali and alkaline earth metals, thus it would be
appropriate to use core valence basis sets such as
cc-pCV$X$Z.\cite{Peterson2002} \citet{Iron2003} also developed core-valence
basis sets for the alkali and alkaline earth-metals, however I was not able to
obtain these basis sets until very recently.\footnotemark These basis sets
should be considered for future benchmarking work. Given these difficulties, I
originally chose the augmented version of the polarization consistent basis sets
of Jensen and co-workers\cite{Jensen2001, Jensen2002, Jensen2002a, Jensen2003}
(aug-pc-\emph{N}, \emph{N}=2,3,4), which have been shown to converge to the CBS
limit systematically\cite{Kupka2007} and are available for all the elements of
interest.

\footnotetext{See http://theochem.weizmann.ac.il/web/papers/group12.html for the
CV$N$Z basis sets for Li, Be, Na, Mg, K, Ca.}

While performing CCSD(T)/CBS calculations, I observed that the metal cations
(and neutral metal atoms), did not converge smoothly to the complete basis set
limit. As a consequence, complete basis set extrapolation is not feasible. In
light of this problem, I decided to re-evaluate the size scope of the benchmark
set being used. In order to facilitate future DFT-based work and probe the issue
of basis set convergence of alkali and alkaline earth metals, a benchmark set of
small substrates was proposed. This new set is shown in \ref{fig:set2}. The new,
small benchmark set was selected to include important functional groups and
radicals found in biological systems, and one of the most common solvents used
in physical organic experiments, acetonitrile.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/set2.eps}
    \caption[Revised benchmark set of small substrates and cations.]{Revised
    benchmark set of small substrates and cations. Note this set consists of all
    combinations of substrates and metal cations, i.e., there are 35 complexes
    in the set.} \label{fig:set2}
\end{scheme}

\subsection{Metal cation basis set convergence}

In order to perform complete basis set (CBS) extrapolation, the total energy of
a molecule/atom should converge smoothly to the CBS limit.\cite{Truhlar1998}
However, CCSD(T,Full)/aug-pc$N$ ($N$=1,2,3,4) calculations for alkali and
alkaline earth-metals convergence of poorly to the CBS limit
(See~\ref{fig:ap_pes_metals}). Examining the energy of each ion relative to the
smallest basis set, for \ch{Li^+} the value appears to converge reasonably,
however this is because there are only 2 electrons in this ion. For all of
\ch{Na^+}, \ch{Mg^{2+}}, \ch{K^+}, and \ch{Ca^{2+}}, there appears to be no
convergence to the CBS limit as no asymptote is reached. This is problematic as
it means that CBS extrapolation would result in a significant degree of
uncertainty in the estimated CBS limit total energy.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/pes_metals}
    \caption[Basis set convergence for alkali and alkaline earth-metal
    cations.]{Basis set convergence of CCSD(T,Full)/aug-pc-$N$ ($N$=1,2,3,4)
    for alkali and alkaline earth-metal cations. The relative energy of each
    basis set relative to the aug-pc-1 for each metal. The cardinal number of
    the aug-pc-$N$ basis sets is $X=N+1$.} \label{fig:ap_pes_metals}
\end{figure}

The poor convergence was thought to be a result of poorly suited basis sets to
full core-correlation. However, the same CCSD(T,Full) calculations using the
core-correlation (cc-pCV$N$Z) basis sets also show unsatisfactory convergence
for \ch{Na^+} and \ch{Mg^{2+}} (See~\ref{fig:ap_pes_metals_2}). Therefore, I was
tasked with finding a method which would give results which best approximate
alkali and alkaline metal binding at the complete basis set limit. I decided to
use an explicitly correlated CCSD(T) treatment known as ``F12$^*$'' to more
rapidly approach the CBS limit.\cite{Tenno2012} I tested both the
core-correlation consistent basis set developed for used with explicitly
correlation (cc-pCV$X$Z-F12),\cite{Peterson2008} and the Ahlrich basis sets
(Def2-SVP,-TZVPPD, and -QZVPPD).\cite{Rappoport2010} Both these basis sets
combined with the CCSD(T,Full)-F12$^*$ methodology gave satisfactory convergence
to the CBS limit for the sodium and magnesium ion
(See~\ref{fig:metals_explicit}) for the convergence of all metal ions calculated
with the CCSD(T,Full-F12$^*$/Def2-QZVPPD method). Given that Def2-QZVPPD is
available for almost every atom on the periodic table, and the observed
convergence to the CBS limit, this basis set was selected for benchmark quality
binding energies.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/ap_pes_metals}
    \caption[Basis set convergence for sodium and magnesium ions with

    basis set relative to the Def2-SVP for each metal. The cardinal number of
    the basis sets is $X$.} \label{fig:metals_explicit}
\end{figure}

To the best of my knowledge, there is no precedent for extrapolating the Ahlrich
basis sets, thus the final benchmark energies are at the
CCSD(T)-F12$^*$/Def2-QZVPPD level of theory, without extrapolation. The
convergence of the total energies of the cations can be estimated as the sum of
the experimental ionization energies of the ions. These results are listed
in~\ref{tab:metal-energy}. The calculated values are too high (i.e., not at the
CBS limit), and deviate from experiment from 0.16 and 0.66 AU (4.4--18 eV).
Deviations of this magnitude are rather significant, and are likely due to the
increasing contribution of ``relativistic effects'' with increasing atomic
number. Additionally, there may be cumulative experimental error, as the
experimental ionization energies range from 4--5500 eV. Relativistic effects
were not considered herein, thus, the calculated binding energies herein are
likely the best available approximation to the non-relativistic gas-phase
metal-substrate binding energy.

CCSD(T,Full)-F12$^*$/Def2-QZVPPD//LC-$\omega$PBE-D3(BJ)/6-311+G(3df,3pd) level
of theory. Some general trends are that alkaline earth-metals bind more strongly
than alkali earth-metals. Also, the order of binding follows the Lewis acidity
of the metal ions: \ch{Mg^{2+}} $>$ \ch{Ca^{2+}} $>$ \ch{Li^+} $>$ \ch{Na^+} $>$
\ch{K^+}. The metals all appear to bind most strongly to the amidic
oxygen-centre, reflecting the higher Lewis basicity. The metals also bind
weakest to the oxygen-centred radicals, with greater binding to \ch{HOO^.} as
compared to \ch{HO^.}.

Next, 31 DFT-based methods combined with a moderate basis set (6-31+G(2d,2p))
and a large basis set (6-311+G(3df,3pd)) were tested for their ability to
estimate the binding energy between metal cations and substrates. The mean

Given the magnitude of the gas-phase binding energies, the overall agreement
between the benchmark values and the DFT-based method values with both moderate
and large basis sets is very good. Interestingly, the application of the
empirical D3(BJ) dispersion correction systematically decreases agreement with
benchmark values as it increases over-binding. Also, going from moderate to
large basis sets systematically increases the predicted binding energies, as
indicated by an increase in MSE across the board. I chose three of the best
performing methods (BMK-D3(BJ), TPSS-D3(BJ), and M05-2X) and performed geometry
optimizations with moderate basis sets on the reference structures to determine
if the choice of method would significantly impact the minimum energy bound
structure. These results are listed in~\ref{tab:ccsd-metal-opt}.

  and average root mean squared deviation (RMSD)(Root mean square deviation was
  calculated using the Kabsch algorithm\protect\cite{Kabsch1976} as implemented

    TPSS-D3(BJ) & 1.25 & 1.21 & 0.026 \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

For all the three methods tested, the average of the root mean square deviations
(RMSD) from reference structures are very small (0.012--0.026 \AA). For
BMK-D3(BJ), re-optimization of the structures results in a slight increase in
MAE, while for TPSS-D3(BJ) and M05-2X, the opposite is true. As a whole, it
seems that DFT-based methods are capable of predicting gas-phase binding
energies for alkali and alkaline metal ions with organic substrates and
radicals. M05-2X appears to be one of the best performing DFT-based methods.
Furthermore, M05-2X is recommended by the QM-ORSA\cite{Galano2013} method, which
outlines ``best principles'' for calculating accurate HAT rate constants in
solution. And finally, M05-2X was previously used by our group in the study of
the HAT reaction between DMSO and \bno,\cite{vanSanten2016} thus I have selected
this method for further study of the effects of alkali and alkaline earth metal
cations on the barrier heights of HAT reactions. Note also that M05-2X is a
hybrid density-functional with 56\% HF-exchange, and thus should not suffer
significantly from delocalization error.

\section{HAT reactions involving non-redox active metals}
\subsection{DMA + \ch{HO^.}}

I was unsuccessful in performing full optimization calculations in the presence
of the metal salt. However, the ``guess'' TS structures obtained by freezing the
hydrogen atom acceptor donor bonds (as described in the Chapter 5 section)
herein represent approximated transition state structures and therefore provide
an estimate of the effects of metal salts in a more biologically relevant model.
The calculated reaction barriers are presented in~\ref{tab:dma-oh}.

\begin{table}[!htbp]

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

For the direct HAT reaction between \ch{OH^.} and DMA abstraction occurs
primarily from the cis position \ch{C-H} bond of DMA. The calculated free energy
(enthalpic) barrier is 7.9(-2.7) \kcalmol, which gives a calculated rate
constant of 1.0 \E{7} \Ms, or three orders of magnitude lower than the predicted
rate constants of 1.5 \E{10} \Ms. This result in unsurprising given the poor
agreement of the calculated values with experiment of HAT reaction between DMA
and \bno\ and \cumo. For abstraction by \ch{HO^.}, the complexation of \ch{NaCl}
to DMA increases the estimated free energy reaction barriers across the board by
4.2--7.7 \kcalmol. This suggests that if \ch{Na^+} interacts closely with DMA in
vivo, then non-redox active metals may have a chemo-protective effect against
hydrogen abstraction by \ch{HO^.}.

For the acetyl position \ch{C-H} bond of DMA, the enthalpic barrier increases by
1.5 \kcalmol, even though the calculated BDE decreases slightly upon
complexation of \ch{NaCl}. This can once again be explained by the effects of
charge transfer in the TS complex. For the TS structure representing direct HAT
between \ch{HO^.} the acetyl position of DMA-NaCl, there is a calculated charge
transfer from DMA to \ch{Na^+} of 0.02 $e^-$, which results in a decrease in
charge separation between \ch{HO^.} and DMA from 0.26 $e^-$ without \ch{NaCl} to
0.25 $e^-$ with \ch{NaCl}. Although this effect is small, it appears to
significantly effect the ability of \ch{HO^.} to abstract a hydrogen atom from
DMA. The same argument applies to both the cis and trans \ch{C-H} bond positions
of DMA, for which the enthalpic barrier increases by more than the calculated
change in BDE. For the significantly more reactive \ch{HO^.} radical, the metal
is less likely to interact with the oxygen centre, thus the effects observed
depend only on interactions with DMA. As a result, the reaction barrier
increases in all cases upon complexation of \ch{NaCl}.

\subsection{Strong hydrogen bond accepting substates}

In the investigation of the effects of metal cations on HAT reactions between
DMA and \cumo\ Salamone et al. demonstrated that in DMSO solvent, HAT reactivity
is not significantly affected by the addition of metal
salts.\cite{Salamone2015metals} This can be explained on the basis of the
stronger Lewis basicity of DMSO as as compared to DMA, resulting in the
competitive binding of \ch{M^n+} to DMSO over DMA. The rate constant for HAT
between DMSO and \cumo\ in DMSO solvent is 1.8 \E{4} \Ms\ while that for DMSO
and \cumo\ is 1.2 \E{6} \Ms\ in MeCN solvent at 298 K, therefore only small
changes in $k_{obs}$ are expected for HAT between \cumo\ and DMA in DMSO solvent
with metal salts. I am interested in how metal salts affect the HAT reactivity
of DMSO and other related strong hydrogen bond accepting substrates. We
previously showed that DMSO and \bno\ react via a radical H-atom donation
reaction, where \bno\ acts counterintuitively as the hydrogen atom donor rather
than acceptor. The net reaction yields benzaldehyde, dimethyl sulfide, and
\ch{HO^.} as the DMSO-H radical decomposes in a concerted manner following the
radical donation of the hydrogen atom by the radical.

An important driving force in this reaction is the formation of benzaldehyde by
cleavage of an acidic $\alpha$-\ch{C-H} bond. This is not possible in \cumo\,
therefore \cumo\ does not react through radical H-atom donation. I have
performed computational studies to determined if metal cations could affect this
reactivity and if the related (HMPA and TBPO) substrates displayed similar
reactivity.

Focussing first of the reactions of DMSO with \cumo\ and \bno\ in the presence
of \ch{NaCl}. The reactions studied are shown in~\ref{fig:dmso-rxn} and the
calculated free energy (enthalpic) barriers are listed in~\ref{tab:dmso-dG}.
Also, the TS structures for the reactions in~\ref{fig:dmso-rxn} are shown
in~\ref{fig:dmso-ts}a-f. Firstly, for HAT between DMSO and \cumo\ in the
presence of \ch{NaCl} (Reaction 1,~\ref{fig:dmso-ts}b), the free energy barrier
increases by 1.5 \kcalmol\, however the enthalpic barrier decreases by 3.7
\kcalmol. This can be explained in a similar manner to the reactions of DMA:
\ch{Na^+} interacts both with the oxygen of DMSO and the aromatic system of
\cumo, resulting in a stabilization of the TS and a decrease in enthalpic
barrier in spite of a predicted increase in \ch{C-H} BDE. This binding however
results in a tighter TS structure, thus the entropic cost increases and so does
the $\Delta G^\ddagger$.

Next, the reaction of DMSO with \bno\ was previously
characterized\cite{Salamone2012} as occurring through the rate determining
formation of a strong pre-reaction complex, however, we more recently showed the
reaction likely takes place through a reaction in which \bno\ acts as a hydrogen
atom donor, rather than acceptor.\cite{vanSanten2016} For this radical H-atom
donation reaction between DMSO and \bno\ in the presence of \ch{NaCl} (Reaction
2,~\ref{fig:dmso-ts}d), the free energy barrier increases as a result of
\ch{NaCl} complexation. This is appears to be an entropic effect as a result of
binding, as $\Delta H^\ddagger$ decreases by 1.2 \kcalmol\ due to the
interaction of \ch{Na} with DMSO and the aromatic ring of \bno. In this TS
structure excluding \ch{NaCl} there is some charge separation, however, DMSO
(the acceptor) has a partial positive charge and \bno\ (the donor) has a partial
negative charge. This is contrary to typical HAT reactions between
oxygen-centred radicals and \ch{C-H} bonds where in the TS structure, the donor
typically has a partial positive charge and the acceptor has a partial positive
charge. Therefore, the significant reduction in charge separation from 0.25
$e^-$ to 0.11 $e^-$ appears to play a lesser role. This may be due to the
unusual electronic structure of sulfoxide compounds, which cannot easily be
defined using simple Lewis structures. The radical H-atom donation reaction is
likely driven by the concerted cleavage of the \ch{S=O} bond of DMSO-H.

While the conventional HAT reaction between DMSO and \bno\ is unlikely to occur
as the barrier is ca.\@ 12 \kcalmol\ higher than the radical H-atom donation
reaction, it is still interesting to consider the effect that \ch{NaCl} has on
the reaction barrier height. \ref{fig:dmso-ts}f shows that in the TS structure
for the HAT reaction between DMSO and \bno\ in the presence of \ch{NaCl}, there
is a relatively close interaction with both the oxygen of DMSO and the aromatic
ring of \bno. As a result, the free energy (enthalpic) barrier decreases by
0.6(5.2) \kcalmol. NPA estimates a relatively large (as compared to the DMA HAT
reactions) 0.10 $e^-$ charge transfer from DMSO to \ch{Na}, resulting in a
decrease in charge separation in the TS structure from 0.27 $e^-$ to 0.21 $e^-$.

Turning now to the reactions of \bno\ with the substrates HMPA and TBPO, which
are closely related phosphine oxide compounds that are commonly used as organic
solvents. These two substrates are also closely related to DMSO in that they are
strong hydrogen bond accepting substrates, and therefore may undergo a radical
H-atom donation reaction in which \bno\ donates an acidic $\alpha$-\ch{C-H}
hydrogen atom, rather than accepting in the conventional manner. The reaction
coordinate diagrams from HMPA with \bno\ and TBPO with \bno\ are shown
in~\ref{fig:hmpa-tbpo-bno}a and b, respectively. In the possible radical H-atom
donation reactions for both substrates the free energy barrier is lower than the
conventional HAT barrier by 6 \kcalmol\ for HMPA and 10 \kcalmol\ for TBPO.
However, in both cases the process is energetically uphill, and so is unlikely
to occur. For both the radical products HMPA-H and TBPO-H, the cleavage of the
\ch{P=O} bond for the subsequent loss of \ch{HO^.} in analogy to the reaction of
DMSO results in an additional 20 \kcalmol\ energy cost owing to the
significantly greater strength of \ch{P=O} bonds as compared to \ch{S=O} bonds
(The BDEs are 86 \kcalmol\ in DMSO vs. 147 \kcalmol\ in
HMPA).\bibnote{Calculated using the ROCBS-QB3 method.} Therefore, radical H-atom
donation reactivity of \bno to DMSO is likely partially driven by the cleavage
of the \ch{S=O} bond in DMSO.

  \label{fig:hmpa-tbpo-bno}
\end{figure}


As \bno\ does not donate a hydrogen atom to HMPA or TBPO, I did not seek the
determine the effects of \ch{NaCl} on these reaction barriers. Note also, that
unlike DMSO, NBO analysis reveals no strong hyperconjugative overlap between the
\ch{P=O} orbitals and the abstractable \ch{C-H} bonds of TBPO or HMPA. From an
orbital energetic standpoint, this is expected, given the overall higher energy
of the \ch{P=O} bond, as compared to the \ch{S=O} bond. Therefore, the effects
of metal complexation to the phosphine oxygen (where \ch{Na} will bind) should
not significantly affect the \ch{C-H} bond strengths or enthalpic barrier
heights. The HAT reaction barrier heights of \ch{NaCl} with with HMPA and TBPO
for the HAT reaction with \cumo\ are listed in~\ref{tab:hmpa-tbpo}. The TS
structures for direct HAT reactions between HMPA or TBPO with \cumo\ and \bno\
including \ch{NaCl} are shown in~\ref{fig:hmpa-tbpo-ts}.

\end{figure}

For HMPA with \cumo\ and \bno\ in the presence of \ch{NaCl}, the HAT reaction
barrier decreases in both cases. For the reaction with \cumo\
(\ref{fig:hmpa-tbpo-ts}a), this can be explained on the basis of the interaction
between \ch{Na} with both the phosphine oxygen and the aromatic system of
\cumo. However for the reaction with \bno\ (\ref{fig:hmpa-tbpo-ts}b), there is
not such interaction with the aromatic system of \bno. In this case, the
decrease in reaction barrier can be ascribed to the lack of rotation of the
\ch{CH2O^.} moiety of \bno. Previously computational
investigations\cite{Salamone2011a,Salamone2012} demonstrate a typical rotation
of the \ch{CH2O^.} moiety of \bno\ of about 30 to 45$^\circ$, while the TS in
\ref{fig:hmpa-tbpo-ts}b has an angle of about 5$^\circ$. In the HAT reaction
between HMPA and \bno\ excluding \ch{NaCl}, there is a rotation of this moiety
by ca. 30$^\circ$. The complexation of \ch{NaCl} breaks the hydrogen bond
between the $\alpha$-\ch{C-H} bond of \bno\ with the oxygen of HMPA, and forms a
now interaction between \ch{Cl^-} and the $\alpha$-\ch{C-H} bond of \bno. This
new interaction stabilizes the TS and allows the oxygen-centre of \bno\ to
remain in the plain of the aromatic system.

Finally, for the reactions of TBPO with \cumo\ and \bno\ there are long range
interactions of \ch{Na} with the aromatic systems resulting in a decrease in
$\Delta H^\ddagger$. The free energy barrier for \cumo\ is not significantly
affected, while it increases by about 1.5 \kcalmol\ for \bno. This is likely due
to the longer range interaction of \ch{Na} with \cumo\ as compared to \bno\
(4.0 \AA\ vs. 3.6 \AA, respectively).
