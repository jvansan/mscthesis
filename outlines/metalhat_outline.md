# Do non-redox active metal cations have the potentials to behave as chemo-protective agents? The Effects on Metal Cations on HAT Reaction Barrier Heights

## Introduction

* Non-redox active metal cations in biological systems
* Experimental (and past theoretical) evidence for inhibition of reactivity

## Benchmarking DFT for metal cation substrate/radical binding

* Need to "calibrate" DFT-based methods before applying to unknown systems
* One previous study
  - Ca2+ with organic substrates
  - Only studied several DFT methods and small variety in substrates
* Wanted to study dipeptide models
  - Computational restrictions did not allow for this
* Use small models for biomolecules, solvents used in kinetics studies, and radicals

### Methods
* Basis set convergence of metal cations!
* Final method CCSD(T)-F12*/Def2-QZVPPD
* Results - Metal cations approach CBS limit - verify w/ expt
 - Focal pt extrapolation for Def2 basis sets?
