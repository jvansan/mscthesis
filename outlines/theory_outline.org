# Effects of Metal Cations of HAT Reactions - Theory 
#+STARTUP: showall

* Theoretical Approaches
  - +Schroedinger Equation+
    - Non-relativistic time independent form
  - +Hartree-Fock Theory+
    - +Spin and Spatial Orbitals+
    - +Hartree-product+
      * Non-interacting electrons
      * Product of N orbitals (spin+spacial coords)
    - +Slater Determinants+
      * Introduce anti-symmetry to wave functions
      * Yields Pauli exclusion
      * electron-exchange interactions for electrons of parallel spin
	- motion of two electrons with parallel spin is correlated
      * Does not correlate motion of electrons of opposite spin
    - +HF Approximation+
      * Need to make approximations to describe many-electron problems
      * Hartree-fock equation 
	- derived from variational principle w.r.t. slater determinants spin orbitals
	- fock operator 
	- Essentially make many-electron -> one-electron with average effects
          from other electrons
	- Non-linear and solved iteratively = self-consistent-field method
    - +Roothan Equation and Solving HF+ 
  - +Basis Sets+
    + MO-LCAO-like method forms linear combinations of basis functions
    + STOs vs GTOs
      * STOs used historically because of similarity with eigenfunctions of H atom
      * STOs hard to calculate integrals for
      * GTOs (integrals easy) used instead -> STO ~ linear combination of GTOs
    + Minimal vs Extended Basis Sets
      * Zeta = cardinal number
      * Split-valence
      * polarization functions
      * diffuse functions
    + Types of Basis Sets
      * Pople
      * Correlation consistent
      * Polarization consistent 
  - +Post-HF Methods+
    + Add electron correlation to HF ground-state
    + Moller-Plesset PT
      * Add electron correlation through Rayleigh-Schrodinger PT
    + Coupled Cluster theory
      * Use exponential cluser operators to construst multi-electron
        wavefunctions -> electron correlation
      * Exponential ansatz
      * Cluster operators
      * Coupled cluster euations 
    + Basis Set Extrapolation
    + Explicit correlation (F12)
  - +Composite Methods (briefly)+
    + What are they
      * Relatively cheap optimization
      * Additive corrections to get "best" wavefunction results
    + Why are they useful
      * Understood to give accurate results for many thermochemical properties
    + Gaussian-n methods
    + CBS methods
    + W1 methods
  - +Density-functional theory+
    + Kohn-Sham
      - All properties of system uniquely defined by ground state rho=p
      - No "recipe" for the "right" answer
    + Computational cost benefit 
    + DFT Energy functional
      - E[p] = Tni[p] + Vne[p] + Vee[p] + 
    + Types of modern functionals
      - GGA -> meta-GGa -> Hybrid -> Range-Separated
      - Benefits to each + relative cost
    + Pitfalls of DFT and corrections thereto
      - Dispersion - D3 correction
      - Self-interaction error
  - +Geometry Optimization and Thermochemistry+
    + Optimization
      * Search for stationary states on global PES
      * Places where derivatives of energy ~ 0 
    + Thermochem - statistical thermodynamics
  - Solvent models
    + Implicit solvation
    + SMD model
      * what is it
      * good because "universal"
* Rate constants and TST
  - QM tunnelling
    + Model for accounting for QM tunnelling
      * Bell Model to determine transmission coefficient
	- Strengths and weaknesses
	- Use of alternative potentials - Eckart
    + QM particles are capable of going through barriers rather than over
    + Important in HAT because light atoms
  - Arrhenius equation 
  - Classical TST
  - Kinetic Isotope Effects
    + Primary KIEs
    + Physical origins
      * ZPE
    + Utility in mechanistic studies
      + Useful in determining H atom being abstracted
  - *G* Somewhere here or in the methods section you will need to connect what
    you're calculating and how. For example, you will discuss TST here, but what
    does that mean in practice? You just need to make sure there is a line
    connecting the Theory to what you've done.
