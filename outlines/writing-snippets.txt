% The systematic investigation of KSEs lead to the development of the
% empirical Snelgrove-Ingold equation\cite{Snelgrove2001,Litwinienko2007}
% (Equation \ref{eq:kse}), which can quantitatively estimate HAT rate constants in
% various solvents.

% \begin{equation}
%   \log(k_H^S) = \log(k_H^0) - 8.3\alpha_2^H_{subst}\beta_2^H
%   \label{eq:kse}
% \end{equation}

% \noindent In the above equation, the rate constant in a given solvent
% ($\logk_H^S$) can be obtained from a reference solvent ($k^0_H$), according to
% the ability of the substrate to donate a hydrogen bond, measursed by the Abraham
% HB donating parameter ($\alpha_2^H_{subst}$),\cite{Abraham1989} and the ability
% of the solvent to accept hydrogen bonds, measured by the Abraham HB accepting
% parameters ($\beta_2^H$).\cite{Abraham1990} Plots of log($k$,\Ms) against
% $\beta_2^H$ give a linear free energy relationship (LFER) which quantifies KSEs
% and gives good correlations for the HAT reactions.\cite{Valgimigli1995,
%   Avila1995,Valgimigli1995,MacFaul1996,Valgimigli1999,Snelgrove2001,Foti2005,Litwinienko2007,Jha2008,Bietti2012}

% Much of the work describing KSEs, including the Snelgrove-Ingold equation,
% ignores the ability of the abstracting radical to HB with solvent. Work by
% \citet{Bietti2012} has demonstrated this may not be true and that the
% Snelgrove-Ingold equation can overestimate HAT rate constants in strong HB
% donating solvents, implying that solvent-radical HB interactions are
% non-neglible.
