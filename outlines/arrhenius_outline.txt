# Arrhenius Pre-Factors and NCIs


* In 2005 paper investigating hydrogen atom transfer reactions in the iminoxyl/oxylimine couple, DiLabio and Ingold compiled a table of self-exchange like reactions between phenolic compounds and oxygen-centred pi-radicals (Table 1)
  - Involve destruction and creation of pi-radicals
  - Arrhenius parameters
    + Ea and A low
  - Reactions look very similar in nature, however, large differences in A-factor
  - Systems with high degree of steric clash have lower A
  - No steric shielding approach normal A values for HAT (~10^8)

* Collection of data = Opportunity to explore the fundamental properties governing HAT reactions

* Work with Arrhenius equation because it is simplest model which gives good results for predicting and understanding rate constants experimentally
  - Good to draw connection between experiment and theory

* Currently we know the following about A-factors:
  - For bimolecular reactions A = Z*p
    + Z represents collision frequency, obtained from gas collision frequency considerations
    + p represents probability of collision being successful
  - Recall from theory that comparison of the Arrhenius and Eyring formulations gives A is related to the enthalpy of formation of the TS (Eq. 2.93)
    + A factor related to entropy --> Number of degrees of freedom that allow for successful reaction
    + Typically refer to "loose" (small p) and "tight" (large p) TS with respect to large and small A-factor values, respectively

* Currently, little literature which describes importance of pre-reaction complexes with respect to kinetics
  - Experimentalists have explained low A factors in phenolic HAT reactions on basis of hydrogen bonding interactions lead to reduced degrees of freedom and therefore larger delta S
  - Quasi-classical trajectory calculations have suggested that pre-reaction complex has a "steering effect" on overall rxn which can enhance rate for simple reactions (F + H2O -> HF + HO, Li et al, Chem Sci, 2013. doi: 10.1039/C2SC21457A)
  - Appears to ignore steric considerations

* Suggest that sterics play role in pre-reaction complex formation as well as TS formation
  - If complex leads directly to TS -> entropic change from separated reactants to TS is mostly captured in formation of pre-reaction complex BUT we're not looking at free energies...

* Ask the question: do A-factors correlate with pre-reaction complex non-covalent binding energies (BE)?
  - Reasonable question given that binding and sterics may lead to reduced degrees of freedom
  - If true, NCIs may be used as a measure of looseness/tightness of TS structure

## Computational Methods
* Conformational Analysis - Performed with BLYP-D3-BSIP/MINIs
  - By hand first
  - Systematic scan of dihedrals seconds
* Optimization + Freq w/ BLYP-D3-BSIP/pc-1
* SP w/ LCwPBE-D3/pc-2-spd
* Exist some small negative frequencies due to large steric bulk and rotation of tBu groups
  - confident sufficiently near local minimum regardless

## Discussion
* Overall poor correlation (R^2=0.33)
* Most data grouped around single line in middle
  - 4 outliers (1,5,6,7)
  - R^2 = 0.95 without outliers
* Why are these outliers? -> Consider fundamental properties of HAT reactions
  - Two important reaction mechanisms to consider here
    + X-H + Y* -> X* + H-Y
    + HAT (hydrogen atom transfer)
      * H* (H+ and e-) transferred through same set of acceptor donor orbitals
      * Requires Y* overlap with H-X sigma* anti-bonding orbital
        - often requires rotation of OH group in phenolic systems
    + CPET (concerted proton electron transfer)
      * H+ and e- transferred through different sets of acceptor and donor orbitals
      * First popular example of organic CPET from Mayer et al (2002)
        - Phenol/Phenoxyl
          + has strong H-bonded complex (~10 kcal/mol)
          + TS orient so that HAT is not possible (O* in pi but HO roughly in plane)
          + e- must transfer through p AOs of O atoms and H+ across the plane
        - Toluene/Benzyl
          + TS oriented for HAT w/ C* aligned with C-H sigma*
      * DiLabio and Johnson (2007) showed important alternative channel for CPET via lone pair-pi and pi-pi partial bonding interactions in TS
        - Important dispersion interactions (ex. pi-stacking)
          + Pre-reaction complex may be of similar energy for open and stacked orientations
          + Partial bonding interaction leads to lower energy TS in stacked system
          + Ex. Toluene/Benzyl and PhOH/tBuOO
        * ! Different orientations of molecules can lead to different interactions in pre-reaction and TS complexes
  - Apply these concepts to systems in Table 1
    + From pre-reaction complex can only help make educated guess about whether HAT or CPET
    + Complexes 2-4,8-10 fall on line
      * Complexes 2 + 3 are very similar
        - Complexes well aligned for HAT TS with small conformational change (CPET unlikely due to steric clash)
          * tBu or Me groups are "blocking" required closeness for HAT, therefore, one substrate must rotate to achieved necessary distance between OH and O*
      * Complex 4
        - Steric clash prevents CPET alignment
        - TS could result from rotation of OH on tBuPhOH
          + Also possible that TS prefers open conformational
          + Open geometry pre-reaction complex is ~ 2kcal/mol less stable than stacked (still lie near to trendline)
        - Both open and stacked TS are possible and fit with expectations
      * Complex 8 and 9 are similar
        - 8 is known to occur through CPET mechanism (DiLabio and Johnson 2007)
          + 9 is very likely to be the same
        - Both complexes require conformational change to achieve necessary orbital overlap
          + Change likely has small barrier due to low degree of steric bulk
      * Complex 10
        - alpha-Tetralin hydroperoxide and tBuOO
          + Compare to HOOH-OOH reaction TS
            * First appearance = have reasonable orientation for CPET mechanism
            * In HOO-H-OOH TS the other HO groups are 90 degrees relative to abstracting H -> Necessary for LP-LP partial bonding interaction
            * aT-OOH is hindered from rotating freely because of non-aromatic ring
            * tBuOO must be rotated 30 degrees to achieve orbital overlap -> sterically unfavourable
    + Complexes 6 and 7 fall above line
      * Complexes optimally aligned for CPET mechanism through partial pi-bonding interaction
    + Complexes 1 and 5 fall below line
      * Both unlikely for CPET to occur due to steric clash between 3tBuPhOH and radicals -> No way to align orbitals correctly
      * Require large conformational change to lead to HAT TS complex

## Summary
* This investigation located lowest energy pre-reaction complexes
* NC Binding energies calculated and compared to experimental A-factors
  - Found when pre-reaction complex correlates to some degree with A-factor
  - Results fall into 3 bins:

    1) Complexes which require small or low barrier conformational change to achieve likely TS -> Fall on line of best fit (LOBF)

    2) Complexes which are optimally aligned for most likely TS -> Fall above LOBF (Larger A)

    3) Complexes which require large degree of conformational change to achieve TS -> Fall below LOBF (Lower A)

  - At simplest level bins may correspond to number of successful collisions (p)
  - Different regimes of sterics leads to different chemical processes -> NC binding energy can be used as a metric of this but doesn't tell the whole story -> must determine if pre-reaction complex relates directly to TS or whether additional steps are necessary to lead to TS
  - Additional work required to verify by extension to more results
  - Computationally challenging to characterise full PES of reaction for large molecules -> starting point of developing fundamental understanding of complex formal HAT reactions and link theoretical to experimental model
