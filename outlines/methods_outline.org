# Effects of Metal Cations of HAT Reactions - Methods
#+STARTUP: showall

* Notation note
  - Quantum methods
    + XXX/YYY//AAA/BBB
    + XXX = method of SP w/ YYY Basis Sets
    + AAA = method of opt w/ BBB Basis Sets
* Pre-Exponent
  - Conformational Analysis - Performed with BLYP-D3-BSIP/MINIs
    + By hand first
    + Systematic scan of dihedrals seconds
  - Optimization + Freq w/ BLYP-D3-BSIP/pc-1
  - SP w/ LCwPBE-D3/pc-2(spd)
  - Exist some small negative frequencies due to large steric bulk -
    + condifident near local minimum regardless
* BDEs
  - W1BD on all species to start
  - B3LYP/cc-pVTZ+d opt on all that W1BD did not converge
    + scale ZPE = 0.985
  - Additional calcs w/ composite methods
    + ROCCSD(T)/LDBS (LDBS = pc-3/3/2/1)//B3LYP/cc-pVTZ+d
    + G4
    + G4(MP2)
    + CBS-QB3
    + ROCBS-QB3
    + CBS-APNO
* Effects of Metal Cations
  - Benchmark Studies
    + Optimizations = Gaussian 
      * LCwPBE-D3/6-31+G** Conformer Search
      * Final OPT LCwPBE-D3/6-311+G(3df,3pd)
    + Turbomole CCSD(T)/CBS w/ cc-pVNZ N=D,T,Q
      * Problems w/ basis set convergence of metal cations
      * Several other basis sets tested
      * Settled on CCSD(T)-F12*/Def2-QZVPPD (check this) for benchmark quality results
    + Tested N DFT methods with M basis sets
      * Good results from X,Y,Z - Chose M05-2X w/ Pople sets
      * Expect good kinetics and thermochem from this method as well - QM-ORSA
  - Effects studies
