Theory Section
Jeff van Santen

* Theoretical Approaches
  - Schroedinger Equation
    + Non-relativistic time independent form
  - Hartree-Fock Theory
    + Spin and Spatial Orbitals
    + Hartree-product
      * Non-interacting electrons
      * Product of N orbitals (spin+spacial coords)
    + Slater Determinants
      * Introduce anti-symmetry to wave functions
      * Yields Pauli exclusion
      * electron-exchange interactions for electrons of parallel spin
	- motion of two electrons with parallel spin is correlated
      * Does not correlate motion of electrons of opposite spin
    + HF Approximation
      * Need to make approximations to describe many-electron problems
      * Hartree-fock equation 
	- derived from variational principle w.r.t. slater determinants spin orbitals
	- fock operator 
	- Essentially make many-electron -> one-electron with average effects
          from other electrons
	- Non-linear and solved iteratively = self-consistent-field method
    + Unrestricted vs. Restricted vs. Restricted Open-Shell
    + Roothan Equation and Solving HF 
  - Basis Sets
    + MO-LCAO-like method forms linear combinations of basis functions
    + STOs vs GTOs
      * STOs used historically because of similarity with eigenfunctions of H atom
      * STOs hard to calculate integrals for
      * GTOs (integrals easy) used instead -> STO ~ linear combination of GTOs
    + Minimal vs Extended Basis Sets
      * Zeta = cardinal number
      * Split-valence
      * polarization functions
      * diffuse functions
    + Types of Basis Sets
      * Pople
      * Correlation consistent
      * Polarization consistent 
    + Basis Set Extrapolation
G		Not unless you're using them for something significant
    + BSIPs?
  - Post-HF Methods
    + Add electron correlation to HF ground-state
    + Moller-Plesset PT
      * Add electron correlation through Rayleigh-Schrodinger PT
    + Coupled Cluster theory
      * Use exponential cluser operators to construst multi-electron
        wavefunctions -> electron correlation
      * Exponential ansatz
      * Cluster operators
      * Coupled cluster euations 
    + Explicit correlation (F12)
G		This would be a better place for the composite methods
G		You'll also need to discuss thermochemistry in here somewhere. Either here or in a separate section. 	
  - Density-functional theory
    + Kohn-Sham
      - All properties of system uniquely defined by ground state rho=p
      - No "recipe" for the "right" answer
    + Computational cost benefit 
    + DFT Energy functional
      - E[p] = Tni[p] + Vne[p] + Vee[p] + 
    + Types of modern functionals
      - GGA -> meta-GGa -> Hybrid -> Range-Separated
      - Benefits to each + relative cost
    + Pitfalls of DFT and corrections thereto
      - Dispersion - D3 correction
      - Self-interaction error
G		Delocalization error

G	Suggest moving Composite methods up
  - Composite Methods (briefly)
    + What are they
      * Relatively cheap optimization
      * Additive corrections to get "best" wavefunction results
    + Why are they useful
      * Understood to give accurate results for many thermochemical properties
    + Gaussian-n methods
    + CBS methods
    + W1 methods
	
G 	The title below doesn't seem appropriate - This is really "Rate Constants and TST"

* Physical Organic Chemistry  
  - Arrhenius equation 
  - Classical TST
  - QM tunnelling
    + QM particles are capable of going through barriers rather than over
    + Important in HAT because light atoms
    + Model for accounting for QM tunnelling
      * Bell Model to determine transmission coefficient
	- Strengths and weaknesses
	- Use of alternative potentials - Eckart
  - Kinetic Isotope Effects
    + Primary KIEs
    + Physical origins
      * ZPE
    + Utility in mechanistic studies
      + Useful in determining H atom being abstracted

G Somewhere here or in the methods section you will need to connect what you're calculating and how. For example, you will discuss TST here, but what does that mean in practice? You just need to make sure there is a line connecting the Theory to what you've done.
