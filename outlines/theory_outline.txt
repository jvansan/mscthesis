* Theoretical Approaches
  - Schroedinger Equation
    + Non-relativistic time independent form
  - Hartree-Fock Theory
    + Spin and Spatial Orbitals
    + Hartree-product
      * Non-interacting electrons
      * Product of N orbitals (spin+spacial coords)
    + Slater Determinants
      * Introduce anti-symmetry to wave functions
      * Yields Pauli exclusion
      * electron-exchange interactions for electrons of parallel spin
	- motion of two electrons with parallel spin is correlated
      * Does not correlate motion of electrons of opposite spin
    + HF Approximation
      * Need to make approximations to describe many-electron problems
      * Hartree-fock equation 
	- derived from variational principle w.r.t. slater determinants spin orbitals
	- fock operator 
	- Essentially make many-electron -> one-electron with average effects
          from other electrons
	- Non-linear and solved iteratively = self-consistent-field method
    + Unrestricted vs. Restricted vs. Restricted Open-Shell
    + Roothan Equation and Solving HF 
  - Basis Sets
    + MO-LCAO-like method forms linear combinations of basis functions
    + STOs vs GTOs
      * STOs used historically because of similarity with eigenfunctions of H atom
      * STOs hard to calculate integrals for
      * GTOs (integrals easy) used instead -> STO ~ linear combination of GTOs
    + Minimal vs Extended Basis Sets
      * Zeta = cardinal number
      * Split-valence
      * polarization functions
      * diffuse functions
    + Types of Basis Sets
      * Pople
      * Correlation consistent
      * Polarization consistent 
    + Basis Set Extrapolation
    + BSIPs?
  - Post-HF Methods
    + Add electron correlation to HF ground-state
    + Moller-Plesset PT
      * Add electron correlation through Rayleigh-Schrodinger PT
    + Coupled Cluster theory
      * Use exponential cluser operators to construst multi-electron
        wavefunctions -> electron correlation
      * Exponential ansatz
      * Cluster operators
      * Coupled cluster euations 
    + Explicit correlation (F12)
  - Density-functional theory
    + Kohn-Sham
      - All properties of system uniquely defined by ground state rho=p
      - No "recipe" for the "right" answer
    + Computational cost benefit 
    + DFT Energy functional
      - E[p] = Tni[p] + Vne[p] + Vee[p] + 
    + Types of modern functionals
      - GGA -> meta-GGa -> Hybrid -> Range-Separated
      - Benefits to each + relative cost
    + Pitfalls of DFT and corrections thereto
      - Dispersion - D3 correction
      - Self-interaction error
  - Composite Methods (briefly)
    + What are they
      * Relatively cheap optimization
      * Additive corrections to get "best" wavefunction results
    + Why are they useful
      * Understood to give accurate results for many thermochemical properties
    + Gaussian-n methods
    + CBS methods
    + W1 methods
* Physical Organic Chemistry  
  - Arrhenius equation 
  - Classical TST
  - QM tunnelling
    + QM particles are capable of going through barriers rather than over
    + Important in HAT because light atoms
    + Model for accounting for QM tunnelling
      * Bell Model to determine transmission coefficient
	- Strengths and weaknesses
	- Use of alternative potentials - Eckart
  - Kinetic Isotope Effects
    + Primary KIEs
    + Physical origins
      * ZPE
    + Utility in mechanistic studies
      + Useful in determining H atom being abstracted
