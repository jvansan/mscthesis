\section{Background}

Radicals are chemical species that tend to be highly reactive due to the
presence of one or more unpaired electrons. Living systems depend on radical
processes as part of normal metabolism\cite{Halliwell2015} but biomaterials,
such as proteins, are susceptible to radical-induced damage. Radical-induced
oxidation of biomaterials has been implicated in a number of degenerative
disease states, including cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple
sclerosis.\cite{Barnham2004, Valko2007, Hwang2013, Halliwell2007}

In biological systems, radicals are derived from many sources. Exogenous sources
include solar radiation and air pollutants, while endogenous sources include
\emph{in vivo} transition metal-ion redox processes, such as in the electron
transport chain involved in cellular respiration.\cite{Turrens2003} Some
processes in the electron transport chain may transfer an electron to molecular
oxygen, forming the superoxide anion (\ch{O2^{.-}}). Superoxide is not a strong
oxidant on its own, however it may become protonated to form the more reactive
hydroperoxyl radical,\cite{Kozmer2014} or disproportionate spontaneously or
catalytically through metalloenzymes such as superoxide dismutase, leading to
the formation of highly reactive oxygen-centred radicals. Oxygen-centred
radicals derive from reactions of \ch{O2} with redox-active
metals.\cite{Halliwell2015}

Oxygen-centred radicals, known as reactive oxygen species (ROSs) in biology, are
particularly important and common due to the previously described nature of
aerobic respiration. The ROSs that are of primary concern are the highly
reactive hydroxyl radicals (\ch{HO^.}), alkoxyl radicals (\ch{RO^.}), superoxide
(\ch{HOO^.}/\ch{O2^{.-}}), and peroxyl radicals
(\ch{ROO^.}).\cite{Halliwell2015} The oxidation of proteins by ROSs occurs
through a radical chain mechanism that has been studied experimentally in
detail.\cite{Berlett1997, Davies2016} This chain reaction occurs when an ROS
initiates a radical chain reaction through hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), single
electron transfer, or addition reactions with protein substrates, leading to
rapid propagation and formation of new radicals. HAT is an extremely important
reaction in the context of oxidative damage. The focus of my work is the
development of an understanding of the fundamental chemistry involved in protein
oxidation through studying small model systems.

Proteins are the most abundant biomaterial in most mammalian biological
systems,\cite{Davies2005} thus understanding their degradation is essential to
understanding degenerative disease. Because proteins are composed of as many as
20 natural amino acid side-chains, as well as the common peptide backbone, there
are a large number of possible reactions. Some of the reactions involved in
protein oxidation are shown in~\ref{fig:proteinoxidation}.

\begin{scheme}[!htbp]

\caption[Common reactions involved in protein oxidation.]{Common reactions
involved in protein oxidation. The reactions are as follows: \textbf{a)}
initiation of radical chain through abstraction by an oxygen-centred radical to
generate an $\alpha$-carbon-centred radical, \textbf{b)} radical addition of
molecular oxygen, \textbf{c)} propagation of the radical chain reaction
generating another $\alpha$-carbon radical and a peroxide. \textbf{d)} Radical
mediated protein oxidation proceeds through multiple steps involving oxygen
centred radicals and molecular oxygens and results in the generation of a
reduced amide (alcohol). Termination of the radical chain reaction can occur in
several ways, including: \textbf{e)} cross-linking of two carbon-centred
radicals, \textbf{f)} fragmentation of an oxygen-centred radical intermediate,
or \textbf{g)} HAT with an antioxidant (AH).}
\label{fig:proteinoxidation}
\end{scheme}

Initial abstraction (Reaction \textbf{a}) often occurs at the $\alpha$-carbon
position (\ch{$\alpha$-CH}), forming a carbon-centred radical
(\ch{$\alpha$-C^.}) that is partially delocalized in the $\pi$-system of the
neighbouring amide and carbonyl groups. Studies have indicated that the
stability of \ch{$\alpha$-C^.} is determined by stereo-electronic effects
related to the planarity of the amide group.\cite{Salamone2014b} As such, steric
bulk in the side-chains, as well as local protein structure (helix, sheet, etc.)
can constrain radical geometries. For example, the most stable $\alpha$-carbon
radicals occur at glycine residues in antiparallel $\beta$-sheets, whereas other
bulkier residues and secondary structures lead to loss of captodative
stabilization.\cite{Rauk2000} Amino acid side-chains are also susceptible to
oxidation. Those side-chains containing sulfur,\cite{Stadtman2004} as well as
tyrosine (which has a fairly weak phenolic O-H bond of about 89
\kcalmol),\cite{Mulder2005} are particularly susceptible to oxidation.

Propagation of the radical chain reaction occurs through various processes. In
the presence of molecular oxygen, rapid addition occurs at the newly formed
\ch{$\alpha$-C^.} (Reaction \textbf{b}), generating a peroxyl radical, which can
carry forward through further HAT reactions (Reaction
\textbf{c}).\cite{Stadtman2003} The mechanism involved in the radical mediated
oxidation of proteins has been studied experimentally using techniques involving
ionizing radiation.\cite{Garrison1962,Garrison1987} The course of this process
is dependent on the availability of either singlet oxygen (\ch{^1O2}), or
superoxide (\ch{O2^{.-}}) or the protonated form, peroxyl radical (\ch{^.OOH}).
A detailed analysis of this process is outside the scope of this thesis, but
ultimately, these reactions lead to the generation of a hydroxyl-amide (Reaction
\textbf{d}).

The radical chain reaction can be terminated through several mechanisms,
including protein-protein cross-linking (Reaction \textbf{e}), or protein
fragmentation (Reaction \textbf{f}). Reactions with antioxidants (\ch{A-H},
Reaction \textbf{g}) also terminate the chain reaction by removing the radical
from the protein system. The sum total of all these processes contribute to the
accumulation of oxidized proteins that are associated with many degenerative
diseases.\cite{Halliwell2006} HAT reactions, which are important steps in the
initiation, propagation, and termination reactions of protein oxidation, are
investigated through small molecular models in this thesis.

\section{Details of HAT reactions}

Developing an understanding of protein and other biomolecular oxidation requires
an understanding of the deceptively simple HAT reactions involved. Formal HAT
reactions are a fundamental radical chemical transformation that have been
studied for more than a century.\cite{Kochi1973, Parsons2000} From an
experimental perspective, HAT reactions that involve oxygen-centred radicals
and non-radical organic substrates are reasonably well characterized: the
effects of different solvents are well understood.\cite{Litwinienko2007}
However, the main challenge faced by many experiments is elucidating the
mechanistic details of a reaction. This is a problem that can be examined by
quantum chemistry, which is the approach that I shall take. Background on the
theory used in this thesis is given in Chapter~\ref{ch:theory}.

In order to investigate HAT reactions, we need to consider the mechanism in
detail. For a simple HAT reaction, there exist several possible mechanisms by
which this transformation can occur. The two most common concerted mechanisms
are direct HAT and proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). At the basic level,
direct HAT involves the transfer of an electron and proton through the same set
of acceptor/donor orbitals, while PCET involves the transfer of an electron and
proton through different sets of orbitals. In practise, this distinction is
poorly described, and is still an active topic of discussion in the
literature.\cite{Cukier1998, Mayer2002, Stubbe2003, Mayer2004, DiLabio2007,
Huynh2007, HammesSchiffer2008, Mayer2010, Weinberg2012, HammesSchiffer2015,
MunozRugeles2017}

The prototypical example demonstrating the difference between direct HAT to PCET
comes from the computational work of Mayer et al.,\cite{Mayer2002} that
describes the self-exchange reactions of benzyl-toluene and phenoxyl-phenol,
shown in~\ref{fig:self1}. These complexes are oriented so that the aromatic
rings are anti relative to one another. In this geometry, the benzyl-toluene
pair undergoes direct HAT, with the $2p-\pi$ orbital of the benzylic carbon
radical oriented at the benzylic hydrogen on toluene. This is described as
direct HAT, as the orbital containing the radical overlaps with the \ch{C-H}
$\sigma^*$ anti-bonding orbital, and thus the transfer of the H atom occurs
through the same set of orbitals (see~\ref{fig:self1} A).

\caption[Self-exchange reactions of the benzyl-toluene couple through direct

\textbf{A.} the benzyl-toluene couple through direct HAT, and \textbf{B.} the
phenoxyl-phenol couple through PCET.}
\label{fig:self1}
\end{scheme}

For the phenoxyl-phenol pair (see~\ref{fig:self1} B), a fairly strongly hydrogen
bonded pre-reaction complex is first formed with a predicted gas-phase binding
enthalpy of -8.1 \kcalmol. As a result of this strong interaction, the TS
structure is such that the oxygen $2p$-orbital of the phenoxyl radical that
nominally contains the unpaired $e^-$ is perpendicular to the hydrogen bond.
Therefore, in order to undergo direct HAT, the hydrogen bond between the phenol
OH and phenoxyl O lone-pair (LP) must break, and a new, weaker hydrogen bond
with the nominally O-centred radical must form. Alternatively, the hydrogen
bonded pre-reaction complex geometry allows the orbital containing the radical
to overlap with the $2p$ LP of the phenol moiety, and the conjugated aromatic
$\pi$-systems in the TS complex. This overlap results in a TS complex with a
singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) that is of $\pi$-symmetry and highly
delocalized. Accordingly, the proton is transferred through the hydrogen bond
and the electron is transferred through the $\pi$-system. This reaction has an
enthalpic barrier height ($\Delta H^{\ddagger}$) of 5.0 \kcalmol~ relative to
the hydrogen bonded complex, so that the barrier is 3.1 \kcalmol~ below the
separated reactants.

The work by \citet{Mayer2002} suggests that hydrogen bonding is a necessary, but
not sufficient, condition for PCET to occur. This then implies that PCET is not
possible between molecules that do not possess hydrogen bonding moieties, such
as carbon atoms. Work by other authors has shown this to be
untrue.\cite{Hatcher2007, DiLabio2007} In particular, \citet{DiLabio2007}
demonstrated that \citet{Mayer2002} neglected the important contributions of
$\pi-\pi$ interactions and LP-$\pi$ interactions. Computational studies revealed
the existence of a TS structure for the benzyl-toluene couple that is 3.7
\kcalmol~ lower in energy than previously reported. This structure has the
aromatic rings in an optimal ``parallel-displaced'' or ``stacked'' conformation,
as observed in the benzene-benzene non-covalently bound
dimer.\cite{Sinnokrot2002} Analysis of the TS structure highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) reveals bonding character between the two
$\pi$-systems, while the SOMO shows anti-bonding character between the
$\pi$-systems, as well as both \ch{C-H} bonds. Thus, there exists a net partial
bonding interaction between the two $\pi$-systems, opening up an additional
electronic channel for electron transfer to occur, while the overlap between the
\ch{C-H} $\sigma^*$ orbital and the singly occupied C $p$-orbital allows for
proton transfer. DiLabio and Johnson also suggested that the phenol-phenoxyl
couple also prefers a $\pi$-stacked TS structure, and compared this to a
structural analogue, a naturally occurring tyrosyl-tyrosine couple in the RNR
enzyme, in which the HAT reaction proceeds through a PCET mechanism. Other
authors have confirmed the existence of a $\pi$-stacked TS structure for the
phenol-phenoxyl couple.\cite{Sirjoosingh2011, HammesSchiffer2015,
MunozRugeles2017}

Hammes-Schiffer has argued that molecular orbital based analysis is insufficient
to describe the distinction between PCET and HAT mechanisms, as it is not always
conclusive.\cite{Skone2006, HammesSchiffer2015} Instead, Hammes-Schiffer has
proposed the use of quantitative diagnostics that measure the non-adiabatic
effects of a reaction, that is, the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation.\cite{Sirjoosingh2011, HammesSchiffer2015} Under these criteria,
electronically non-adiabatic and adiabatic proton-transfer occur for PCET and
HAT mechanisms, respectively. This was demonstrated using the non-stacked TS
structures for the self-exchange reactions of the phenol-phenoxyl and
benzyl-toluene couples. To complicate the matter further, work by
\citet{Inagaki2011} and \citet{MunozRugeles2017} has demonstrated that in the
favoured stacked TS structures for the above self-exchange reactions, there are
no non-adiabatic effects. This can be interpreted in two different ways:
Firstly, $\pi$-$\pi$-stacking changes the mechanism of the phenol-phenoxyl
self-exchange reaction from PCET to HAT, as suggested by \citet{Inagaki2011}
Alternatively, \citet{MunozRugeles2017} demonstrated that $\pi$-$\pi$-stacking
orbital interactions can ``turn off'' non-adiabatic effects, while the electron
and proton are transferred through different sets of acceptor and donor
orbitals, thus fitting within the definition of a PCET mechanism. While this
highlights the active discussion of the HAT/PCET field, in this work I shall
utilize the latter interpretation, which treats MO overlap as a qualifier for
the PCET mechanism.

\begin{scheme}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/CisVSTrans.png}
  \caption[Possible cisoid (stacked) and transoid TS structures for the

  the benzyl-toluene couple, \textbf{B.} the peroxyl-toluene couple, and
  \textbf{C.} the iminoxyl-oxime couple.}
  \label{fig:self2}
\end{scheme}

HAT can also occur through a PCET mechanism for species that have LP-$\pi$ or
LP-LP overlap in the TS complex.\cite{DiLabio2007, DiLabio2005}
\citet{DiLabio2007} showed that the formal HAT reaction between phenol and the
$t$-butyl peroxyl radical exhibits orbital overlap between the non-radical
O-lone pair of $t$-butyl peroxyl and the aromatic $\pi$-system of phenol in the
lowest energy cisoid TS complex. As with the benzyl-toluene couple, there is
both a bonding interaction in the HOMO of the TS structure, and an anti-bonding
interaction in the SOMO of the TS structure. Therefore, there exists a net
partial bonding interaction that allows electron transfer through the LP-$\pi$
interaction and proton transfer through the hydrogen bond. \citet{DiLabio2005}
also showed that iminoxyl-oxime self-exchange reactions occur through a
five-centred PCET TS complex. The lowest energy transition states for
iminoxyl-oxime couples are cisoid, such that the LPs of the nitrogen centres
overlap, opening a channel for electron transfer, while proton transfer occurs
between the two oxygen centres. Examples of cisoid and transoid TS structures
are shown in~\ref{fig:self2}.


Bearing in mind there is not an obvious way to explore the related differences
in mechanism experimentally, computational examination of formal HAT reactions
enables analysis of the mechanism of these reactions. Herein, I shall consider
the existence of these mechanisms on a continuum: Reactions where an unambiguous
$\pi$-$\pi$ stacked PCET TS structure is formed (for example the \ch{PhO^. +
PhOH} self-exchange reaction) have the most PCET character, and therefore have
the lowest reaction barriers; while reactions where an unambiguous direct HAT TS
structure is formed (for example the \ch{CH3^. + CH4} self-exchange reaction)
have the most HAT character, and therefore have the highest reaction barriers.
In the middle are PCET reactions that may occur through either LP-$\pi$ (more
PCET character) or LP-LP interactions (less PCET character). The use of this
analysis provides important insight into the electronic behaviour of these
reactions. In this vein, the investigation of the physico-chemical nature of HAT
reactions shall be the central theme of this thesis.

\section{Research goals}

Consider for a moment the potential energy surface (PES) for an arbitrary
chemical reaction. Theoretical methods can be used to generate a full PES
However, this quickly becomes computationally unfeasible as the number of atoms
in a system increases. Typically this problem can be simplified by examining
only the relevant degrees of freedom. Often, the two most important coordinates
can be isolated, giving a three-dimensional PES.\@ Furthermore, in chemistry we
often simplify this problem to two dimensions using the so-called intrinsic
reaction coordinate, which is the lowest energy cross section of a higher
dimension PES.\@ This yields a reaction coordinate diagram, as is illustrated
below in~\ref{fig:pes}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/pes}
  \caption[A typical reaction coordinate diagram.]{A typical reaction
  coordinate diagram.}
\label{fig:pes}
\end{figure}

In a typical reaction coordinate diagram, the reactants begin to interact and
form a pre-reaction complex. Given sufficient energy, the reaction will proceed
over the top of the energy barrier through a TS complex. After the chemical
transformation is completed, a post-reaction complex is formed and then the
products separate. This is a somewhat simplified description, as it only broadly
describes a chemical transformation. In particular, the roles of
substrate-radical and substrate-radical-medium interactions along the reaction
coordinate are not fully described. This is in fact a key point, as a thorough
understanding of these interactions continues to be lacking in the literature.

Consequently, recent work from our group, in collaboration with our experimental
colleagues at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, has focused on the importance
of substrate-radical interactions in determining the kinetics of HAT reactions.
Specifically, it has been shown that the three-dimensional structures of
oxygen-centred radicals, as well as the organic substrates, impact the nature of
the interactions involved in HAT reaction pathways.\cite{Salamone2015Rev} In our
work, we utilize primarily the benzyloxyl (\bno) and cumyloxyl (\cumo) radicals,
which serve as proxies for biological oxygen-centred radicals. This is primarily
due to the fact that reactions involving \bno\ and \cumo\ are relatively long
lived in solution, and can be monitored using time-resolved laser flash
photolysis (LFP) techniques. These radicals are somewhat different than
biologically relevant radicals such as \ch{HO^.}, and as a result, the
reactivity trends pertaining to the substrates can be somewhat masked by the
properties of the radical, such as steric bulk,\cite{Finn2004} or non-covalent
binding.\cite{Salamone2011b} Nonetheless, through a careful combination of
theoretical and experimental techniques, reactions involving \bno\ and \cumo\
with a variety of organic substrates have been used to develop a great deal of
insight with respect to the role of structure in both the radicals and
substrates, and resulting intermolecular interactions.

With respect to the work in this thesis, in Chapter~\ref{ch:arrhenius} the
importance of the left-hand side of~\ref{fig:pes} shall be examined by studying
how the pre-reaction complex impacts HAT reactions. There has been limited
investigation of the importance of pre-reaction complex formation for HAT
reaction.\cite{Kreilick1966} This is problematic, as oxygen-centred radicals can
hydrogen bond with substrates as both acceptors and donors.\cite{Johnson2009a}
These hydrogen bonding interactions, in addition to the other non-covalent
interactions between the radical and substrate, lead to the formation of a
pre-reaction complex. Accordingly, the formation of a pre-reaction complex is a
fundamental step in the model systems that have been used to study HAT.

The specific aim of Chapter~\ref{ch:arrhenius} is to investigate the effects of
non-covalent binding in the pre-reaction complex, with respect to the
well-known, but phenomenological, Arrhenius equation. As of yet, there is no
framework that relates the non-covalently bound pre-reaction complex to kinetic
results. I ask the simple question: Does there exist a direct correlation
between the Arrhenius pre-factor and the non-covalent binding that occurs in the
pre-reaction complex formed for HAT reactions? To address this question, I
examine the non-covalent binding in the pre-reaction complex in a series of
related HAT reactions. Arrhenius parameters for the systems of interest in this
work were previously tabulated,\cite{DiLabio2005} and consist of thermoneutral
or nearly thermoneutral reactions involving the formation and destruction of
oxygen-centred radicals. These reactions are related to the phenol-phenoxyl
self-exchange reaction, where a relatively strong pre-reaction complex is
expected.

Then in Chapter~\ref{ch:bde}, the right-hand side of~\ref{fig:pes} is
considered, where the effects of bond dissociation enthalpies (BDEs) on HAT rate
constants are examined. BDEs are central to the understanding of reactions with
respect to thermodynamics. In addition to this, there exists a tremendous amount
of literature in which BDEs are linked to chemical reactivity, especially for
HAT reactions.\cite{Kochi1973, Tedder1982, Wijtmans2003, Pratt2004, Mayer2004}
There is a linear free energy relationship (LFER) called the Bell-Evans-Polanyi
(BEP) principle,\cite{Bell1936,Evans1938} which states that the difference in
activation energy ($E_a$) for two related reactions is proportional to the
differences in reaction enthalpy ($\Delta H$):

\begin{equation}
  E_a = E_0 + \alpha \Delta H
  \label{eq:bep}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $E_0$ is the activation energy of a reference reaction, and
$\alpha$, a constant that characterizes the position of the TS along the
reaction coordinate. This relationship has been generally used to compare
larger families of reactions. Despite the widespread use of the BEP principle,
the validity of this relationship is not well described.

I probe the generality of the BEP principle for a series of HAT reactions from
\ch{C-H} bonds, with the aim to determine how generally it may be applied. This
is achieved by relating accurate, theoretically determined \ch{C-H} BDEs for
species that undergo abstraction at the appropriate \ch{C-H} position, to the
experimentally determined HAT rate constants. HAT reaction rate constants
depends on many factors. However, by using rate constants determined under
specific conditions (LFP with \cumo\ in acetonitrile at 298K), the differences
in reactivity depend mainly on the differences in chemical properties of the
substrates of interest. Therefore, if the BEP relation is valid, there should
exist two relationships for \ch{C-H} bonds: one in which the incipient radical
is delocalized into a $\pi$-system (benzylic-allylic), and the other in which
the remaining alkyl radicals are largely localized.

Finally, recent experimental results show that non-redox active metal cations,
which are found ubiquitously in biological systems, have an inhibitory effect on
HAT reactions involving oxygen-centred radicals. This has been demonstrated
experimentally for substrates that undergo abstraction from sites adjacent to
heteroatoms (e.g.\ amines, amides, and ethers). Under various stoichiometric
ratios, these metal cations have effects ranging from full inhibition to partial
deactivation of HAT reactivity.\cite{Salamone2013a, Salamone2015metals,
Salamone2016} This effect has been attributed partially to the effects of
hyperconjugative overlap. Take for example tetrahydrofuran (THF), shown
in~\ref{fig:THF}. In the absence of other species, there exists \ch{C-H} bond
weakening hyperconjugative overlap of electron density from one of the oxygen
LPs and the adjacent \ch{C-H} $\sigma^*$ anti-bonding orbitals. The interaction
of a metal cation with the oxygen LPs removes electron density from the \ch{C-H}
$\sigma^*$, thus increasing the \ch{C-H} bond strength. As a result, the
reactivity of this bond is decreased, as observed from the
experimentally-measured 3.2-fold decrease in the rate constant for HAT with
\cumo\ in acetonitrile from 5.8 \E{6} \Ms\ to 1.8 \E{6} \Ms\ in the presence of
1.0 M \ch{Mg(ClO4)2}.\cite{Salamone2013a}

  \ch{C-H} bond strength, thus destabilizing the TS complex.} \label{fig:THF}
\end{scheme}

The nature of the interactions between non-redox active metal cations and
organic substrates is poorly understood. This problem is explored in
Chapter~\ref{ch:hat}, with the aim to understand the fundamental
physico-chemical properties that lead to the observed trends in reactivity. The
experimentally observed effects have led us to hypothesize that the presence of
non-redox active metal cations has a chemo-protective effect against the
radical-induced oxidation of biomaterials such as proteins.

In using theory to study HAT reactions, I hope to contribute to a better
understanding of the fundamental properties that govern these reactions, and
thus develop insights into the many important biological processes in which HAT
takes place.
