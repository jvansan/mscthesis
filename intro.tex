\chapter{Introduction}

This sample thesis\index{thesis} discusses changes from the
sample\index{sample} thesis of Michael Forbes, that make the thesis
compliant\index{compliant} with UBCO College of Graduate Studies
standards. If you need more information about the template and LaTeX,
please check out the sample thesis of Michael Forbes at

\href{http://alum.mit.edu/www/mforbes/projects/ubcthesis/}{http://alum.mit.edu/www/mforbes/projects/ubcthesis/}.

%Include citations in your thesis as you write:

\section{Packages}

There are several packages\index{packages} included in
\texttt{ubcostyle.sty}. So before you add a new package, check first
if it is already included there.

\section{Glossary}

Should you wish to provide a glossary of notation, the ubcostyle file
uses the package \texttt{glossaries}. Please read the documentation
for this package.

In short, you need to define glossary entries with a keyword at the beginning of the document. You can use the \texttt{gls} with the keyword to add the corresponding page number to the glossary, where the gls command appears. In general, only use this at the place where a symbol or notation is introduced the first time. Sorting can be done with the sort keyword. You can use subgroups (like number sets, operator families, etc.). However, within a group, sorting should be according to appearance in the document.

Once you have all your entries defined, compile your LaTex document. After that, open a command line terminal and \texttt{cd} into the directory of your thesis. If your thesis file name is \texttt{ubc\_2010\_spring\_doe\_jane.tex} (which is standard file name required by UBC circle when uploading the thesis), then type

\texttt{makeglossaries ubc\_2010\_spring\_doe\_jane}\\
and compile your document again. The glossary should be there.

\section{Index}

Should you wish to provide an index, you need to add commands
\texttt{\\index{thesis}} at the appropriate position in your
text. Then run the makeindex command as \texttt{makeindex myfile.idx
  -t myfile.ilg -o myfile.ind}.  where myfile is replaced by your
filename e.g. ubc\_2010\_spring\_doe\_jane-index-glossary

\section{Epigraph}

If you want to add an epigraph to a chapter (epigraph in the sense of
a literary inscription, not a function epigraph), you can use the
command \texttt{epigraph} after the chapter. Check out the
documentation of the \texttt{epigraph} package for more information.

The following are examples of how to incorporate graphics into your thesis.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figure}
    \caption[Sample figure.]{\label{fig:happy} This is a sample figure
      Note that we have
      used the optional argument for the caption command so that only
      a short version of this caption occurs in the list of figures.}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figure}
    \caption{\label{fig:happy2} This is the same sample figure with still
			a long caption but this time we did not use a short caption command
			in the table of figures.}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

You should really put text in between figures so LaTeX has more
flexibility to place the figure at the appropriate location.

\begin{figure}
	\centering

	\subfigure[Figure on the left side is identical to the one on the right.]{
		\includegraphics[width=150px]{figure}
		\label{fig:ex-ppa-l1-linf-1}
	}
	\subfigure[Figure on the right side is identical to the one on the left.]{
		\includegraphics[width=150px]{figure.pdf}
		\label{fig:ex-ppa-l1-linf-2}
	}
