\chapter{Acknowledgements}      % Optional
This is the place to thank professional colleagues and people who have
given you the most help during the course of your graduate work.

\chapter{Dedication} % Optional
The dedication is usually quite short, and is a personal rather than
an academic recognition.  The \emph{Dedication} does not have to be
titled, but it must appear in the table of contents.  If you want to
skip the chapter title but still enter it into the Table of Contents,
use this command \verb|\chapter[Dedication]{}|.
